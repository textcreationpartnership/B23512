            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>The Authors Preface.</head>
            <p>AƲthors who have treated of Chymistry have had very different discoveries and Apprehensions, and thence it is that they have disagreed ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>h in their Writings. Those who have applied themselves unto the high Chymistry, and have penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into its greatest mysteries, have contented them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with the knowledg thereof; and though it may seem that they Wrote with an intent to be understood, yet they have penned things so obscurely, that they gave us no grounds to question whether they uttered realties, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> have given us Fantoms for Bodies, and Thorns for Fruits: Others who have not soared so high, have notwithstanding had some good skill therein, and have themselves discovered some preparations, which have made them considerable to Posterity; but some of these have sought their own satisfaction also, and taken plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure to perplex mens minds, and to cast them into Labyrinths, without giving them any means of retrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thence.</p>
            <p>Others much less capable, have yet attained some small light, but not knowing all, nor having wrought themselves what they write, and desiring for all that, to pass for sufficient Artists in a Profession they had learnt by halves only, they made their Imaginations pass for certain Truths, whose falshood and imperfection the Practise hath frequently discovered.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Finally.</hi> Others, which deserve not the name of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mists, but rather of ignorant Blowfires, working by copied or stolen Receipts, which they commonly take in some contrary sense, and having consumed their own, or others mony in a ridiculous Labour, have made ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others accompany them in their fortunes, engaging the vulgar by promises of enriching them in certain practises, whereby they have reduced the best Metal into Smoak, unless perhaps they past some part of it through their own hand, which is not the least of their Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Hence it is that I wonder not, that many have
<pb facs="tcp:48577:4"/> declamed against such Authors, and against Chymistry it self; having not understood truly the good things which it contains. As for my self, who profess to say nothing but what I know, and to write nothing but what I have done, I purpose only in this little <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tise,</hi> to publish a short and easy method for the happy attainment of all the most necessary preparations of Chymistry. Those who take the pains to read and well consider it, shall observe therein nothing tedious, super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous, or defective in any point which ought to be known: and though indeed the Preparations of all things cannot be found therein, yet sufficient examples thereof will be had from it. And though it was very difficult to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise in this little <hi>Tract,</hi> all the discoveries which I have made in this Profession, yet I have not concealed any manual Operation, and have sincerely discovered all the circumstances necessary to make a good Artist, and by practice to attain the greatest knowledg thereof. I set down no Preparation but what I have made and well experienced, and what any one following the Rules I have prescribed; may do after me. I speak very suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinctly of the <hi>Theory,</hi> but I say so much therein as is necessary for direction to the preparations, and you may find in a few words the substance of many great Books.</p>
            <p>I confine my self to Operation on <hi>Minerals, Vegi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables,</hi> and <hi>Animals,</hi> and proceed therein orderly, and forget nothing that is necessary. I am perswaded that the experience of all that which I have advanced, will manifest my communicative freeness unto all, and that they will be well pleased with the care that I have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken therein. Ʋnto which I have thought my self so much the more obliged by the choice which Monsieur <hi>Vallot,</hi> his Majesties chief and most worthy <hi>Physician,</hi> hath made of me, to make the publick Chmical Lectures and Preparations in the Royal Garden. For this cause I have desired to manifest as well by writing as work, that I have no other design than to acknowledg the honour he hath done me, by giving satisfaction to the publick, according to his inclination, by all ways which are possible for me.</p>

            <head>The <hi>French</hi> Printer to the READER.</head>
            <p>THE favourable reception which this Book met with from the Publick in its former Editi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons has made me undertake this fourth, in which I have endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pursue as much as possible the Author's design; who the first time he published it, was moved so to do, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by the desire of being useful to those who delight in <hi>Chymistry;</hi> by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scovering to them many hidden Myste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries which he made plain and open by the easiness of his Method. The second Edition was not only enriched by some Cuts, and encreased by some new Experiments, but it was likewise adorned with an <hi>Epistle Dedicatory</hi> to to Monsieur <hi>Vallot,</hi> his most Christian Majesties first Physician, a person to whom Chymistry was not a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding, if it were but for having cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen our Author to teach it in the Royal Physick Garden at <hi>Paris,</hi> where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantly
<pb facs="tcp:48577:5"/> performed publick Lectures of it. The method he follows is clear and easily practicable; comprehending in few words the substance of great Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes. Whosoever reads it attentively, may observe that there are no super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous Cantings, nor any thing omitted of what is necessary to be known, and though one does not find here the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of all things in particular; yet there are Examples of every thing by which one may prepare others of the like kind, this one way be sure of, tha the does not communicate any one Operation but he has first put it in practice; and so as by following exactly his Rules, any body may perform it after him: For far from concealing any slight of hand, or other myst<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ry, he does what he can to discover all those means by which a good Artist is made, and all circumstances of Operations which may give light to ingenuous persons of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a greater skill. He speaks but sparingly of the Theory of this Art, and yet he delivers so much of it as is necessary to know in the Operations upon <hi>Minerals, Vegitables,</hi> and <hi>Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals.</hi>

               <p>MY Design in this Treatise is to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct the Publick in all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of the Art of Chymistry, as well in its Practice as in its Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; and that by the shortest and most intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible method of any that has been yet seen:
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:48577:11"/> and we will begin by the different names which have been given it, as well by the Ancients, as by modern Writers.</p>
               <p>The Etymology, or derivation of the word <hi>Chymistry,</hi> comes from the <hi>Greek</hi> Verb <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies to melt; or if you please, you may derive it from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is a juice, because it does as it were draw the interior juice of all bodies: it is called likewise the <hi>Spagyrick</hi> Art, from two <hi>Greek</hi> words, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which signifies, to separate; and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which is, to congregate, or unite; which are the two Operations about which it is most particularly employed. Some call it <hi>Pyrotechnia,</hi> from <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Fire, and <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, an Art, being an Art whose Operations are most performed by Fire: Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, some others name it the <hi>Hermetick</hi> Art, because of <hi>Hermes</hi> a great Philosopher, who was the most Ancient and Famous Professor of this Art. The particle <hi>al</hi> is added to it, and it is called <hi>Alchymia,</hi> in imitation of the <hi>Arabs,</hi> who use it in the beginning of words, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press the excellency or supereminency of a thing; but for us, leaving all its other names, we shall stick to that of Chymistry, as being now the most in use; and though Authors have bestowed many definitions upon it, yet those have best known its nature who have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fin'd it. A <hi>Scientifick</hi> Art, by which one learns to dissolve bodies, and draw from them the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent substances of their composition, and how to unite them again, and exalt them to an higher perfection.</p>

               <p>THey that have any true knowledg of this Noble Art, are without doubt fully per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swaded of the usefulness of it; for it is the key which alone can unlock to all Naturalists the door of Nature's secrets; by reducing things to their first principles; by giving of them new forms; and by imitating Nature in all its productions and Physical alterations. Without it Physitians would be at a stand how to penetrate into the many Fermentations, Effer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vescencies, Distillations, and other Operations, which are performed in the body of man, and are the immediate cause of many grievous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stempers; to which Art the same Physitians must be beholding for the Remedy as well as the Knowledg of the Disease; for we must own that Chymistry does furnish us with the more effectual Medicines for the more invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and obstinate Affections, and often supply the failings and deficiencies of those of the vulgar <hi>Pharmacy.</hi> Chirurgeons likewise can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be without Chymistry, nor can with good success undertake the Cure of all Diseases per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining to their Art without Chymical Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies,
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:48577:12"/> and knowledg of their Operations: And it is impossible that <hi>Apothecaries</hi> should make their compositions like true Artists, if they know not how to preserve the principal vertue of their Ingredients, and separate the pure from the impure, and heterogeneous in natural commixtures, as unprofitable to their intention, which is not learned without the aid of this noble and excellent Art. Finally, most of the ingenious mechanick Arts are beholding to this: Painters have from it their most live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and glorious Colours: Engravers cannot work without the assistance of those corrosive Spirits prepared by Chymistry: Diers cannot exalt their Colours without the instruction of Chymists: One might alledg an infinity of other such Examples, which might prove the necessity of this Art; but we omit them for brevity sake.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> Of the Subject-matter of Chymistry, and its Functions.</head>
               <p>THis Art is of a very great extent, since it embraces for its Subject the bodies of the three Families, Animal, Vegetable, and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; which by fire it reduces into different
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:48577:12"/> substances, which the Philosophers call <hi>First Principles,</hi> and do constitute five of them, of which three are Active, and two Passive. The Active are, the Spirit which is called <hi>Mercury,</hi> the Oil which is called <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and the <hi>Salt,</hi> which has no other name. The Passive Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are the <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Flegm,</hi> and the <hi>Earth</hi> or Terrestrial part: These names are bestowed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them for the likeness they have to common <hi>Mercury, Sulphur</hi> and <hi>Salt,</hi> and the Elementary water and earth: the <hi>Mercury</hi> appears to us in the resolution of bodies, in form of a most aerial subtil liquor; the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is apparent to our smell and tast, by which we distinguish it from the insipid and inodorous Flegm, which sometimes ascends with it; and it appears to us in the form of a penetrating inflamable Oil; the <hi>Salt</hi> remains joyn'd to the body of the earth till it be extracted by elevation. Now while these Principles remain in the body of the mixt, those that are Active are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded with the Passive, so that their vertue is hidden, and as it were, buried; but Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry coming to separate them, purifies each by it self, then unites them again, to make of them bodies much purer, and more Active than they were before. We will now treat of each of these Principles in particular.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. IV.</hi> Of the three Active Principles, <hi>Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Salt.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>TO begin with <hi>Mercury,</hi> or the Spirit, which, as the most excellent of the three, does in the resolving of bodies, first present it self to our senses; we shall say that it is a subtil, light, and penetrating substance, which gives life and motion to bodies, makes them grow and vegetate; and because it is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual action and motion, it would not long stay in any body, if it were not retained by the other Principles more fix and stable than it self: And from hence it follows, that those Mixts in which this substance predominates, are not very durable; as we may observe in Animals and Vegetables, which perish much sooner than Minerals and Metals, which are almost destitute of this Principle.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sulphur</hi> is the second Active Principle, but much inferior to the Spirit; its substance is oleaginous, subtil, penetrating, and inflamable; it is easily reduced into a pure Principle as well as the others. When it contains some spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and aery Particles, it swims upon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as the <hi>Aromatick</hi> subtil Oils of Rose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:48577:13"/> Sage, Turpentine, and others; and if it contain some part of Salt and Earth, then it is a thick and heavy Oil, which sometimes swims in the middle of the Flegm, sometimes goes to the bottom; as we observe in the Oils of <hi>Gums, Bitumens,</hi> and <hi>Gross Woods, &amp;c.</hi> which are distilled with violent fire: 'Tis this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple which is said to cause Beauty or Defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in Animals, of the different smells and colours in Vegetables, and of the ductibility and malleability of Metals. It binds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the other Principles, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out him would fall a-sunder, by reason of their little correspondence and contrarieties; it preserves bodies from corruption, sweetens the <hi>acrimony</hi> of Salts and Spirits; and being of a fiery nature, it preserves those Vegetables where it abounds, from the rigour of cold and frosts, and other injuries of the weather; as we may observe in <hi>Cyprus</hi> and <hi>Fir-trees,</hi> and others that are green all Winter.</p>
               <p>The third Active Principle is <hi>Salt,</hi> which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to us after that the volatile parts are eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porated and exhal'd, because it remaineth its self fix'd with the earth, from which it is se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by dissolution and evaporation; then it offers its self to our view in the form of a brittle substance easily pulveriz'd; and that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrates its driness, which appears likewise by its desire of moisture, which it attracts from the Air so powerfully, that in a small time it becomes fluid. The way of purifying the <hi>Salt</hi> is by fire, and it is incombustible: its office in
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:48577:14"/> the Mixt is to retain the Spirit, and preserve the <hi>Sulphur</hi> from combustion, and is as it were their common Basis or Foundation; it is the cause of the different tasts of things, and ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders those bodies where it abounds, so durable, that they are almost incorruptible: As for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; the Oke, which has in it much Salt, and little Oil, is of a lasting subsistence, and so are many other Mixts of the same nature.</p>

               </head>
               <p>VVE must now speak of the Passive Principles, of which the <hi>Water</hi> or <hi>Flegm</hi> is the first; and though it seem to be of little or no use in bodies, nay, and is hurtful, being the substances where it abounds, are easily corrupted; nevertheless it has its utility. 'Tis by it that the Salt is dissolved and incorporated with the Spirit and <hi>Sulphur,</hi> in which union the Salt would hinder, by its binding too much, their action and vegetative motion, if it were not allaid by the water, which likewise cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the <hi>acrimony</hi> of the Salt and Spirit, and hinders the inflammability of the Oil.</p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:48577:14"/>
               <p>The <hi>Earth</hi> is the last of all our Principles; and though it be esteemed of little benefit in natural mixture, it is not unnecessary, since it retains the Salt, and the other Active Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which would else be easily dissolved, and carried away by the water. When it is entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly destitute of all the other Principles, it is called <hi>Terra damnata,</hi> or <hi>damned Earth:</hi> The use of it in Chymistry, is, only to hinder the Salts from being too easily melted down; and so we forbear to treat any further of it.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VI.</hi> Of all those different Operations which are used in the opening and reducing of mixt bodies to their first Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples.</head>
               <p>THE mixt bodies of the three Families of <hi>Vegetable, Animal,</hi> and <hi>Mineral,</hi> are in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite numbers, and do differ much in hardness, solidity, weight, softness, porosity and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and this has obliged Artists to seek out all ways to attain their ends, and by consequent to use great variety of necessary Operations, upon which they have bestowed as great a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versity of terms of Art, whereof some carry their signification with them, and others are
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:48577:15"/> to be explained to young Chymists, which we shall do by an Alphabetical order.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Alkoolize,</hi> is to reduce solid substances into a very fine impalpable powder; and it is likewise to purify and refine all Spirits and Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sences of their Flegm, and other impurities; whence the Spirit of Wine well rectified, is called the <hi>Alkool</hi> of Wine.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Amalgame,</hi> is to calcine any Metal by the means of ordinary <hi>Mercury</hi> or <hi>Quicksilver;</hi> and this Operation serves to reduce the most perfect Metals into very small particles; for when they are incorporated together, the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tists by a gentle fire causes the <hi>Mercury</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hale, and leave the Metal reduc'd into Powder in the bottom of the Crucible; and so prepares it to be more easily dissolved by any other <hi>Menstruum:</hi> this Operation is much used by <hi>Goldsmiths</hi> and <hi>Guilders,</hi> who by this means make Gold fluid, and easily extended upon those things they intend to guild. Observe that Iron and Copper cannot be <hi>Amalgam'd</hi> by <hi>Mercury;</hi> these two Metals being very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure and terrestrious, and of little sympathy with <hi>Mercury,</hi> who is of a subtil refin'd sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Calcine,</hi> is to reduce into a <hi>Calx</hi> or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, either by Actual, or by Potential fire. Actual fire is that elementary fire which we keep and entertain by combustible substances, as Wood, Coals, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Potential fire is the fire of <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and other corrosive Spirits; Calcination belongs more to Minerals, than Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:48577:15"/> and Animals, which may be cinderiz'd by ordinary burning; but Minerals and Metals require most active and violent fires.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cimentation</hi> is to purifie and examine Gold, which one reduces into thin Plates, and puts into a Crucible with a royal Ciment, which consumes and reduces to dross or cinders all the other Metals that are mingled with Gold.</p>
               <p>Liquors are circulated in vessels for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, and upon a convenient fire, sometimes in order to the fixing of the volatile Spirits, sometimes to volatilize the fix'd Salts; 'tis one of the most important Operations of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mistry.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Coagulate,</hi> is to make those things hard and solid which before were soft and liquid; which is done by depriving them of their moisture, or consuming it; as in the evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of those liquors which contain some Salt in them; or in mingling corrosive Spirits with fixed Salts: as for example, the water of Flint, or Crystal mingled with <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> is coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated into an hard mass, though both these were liquid before.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Cohobation,</hi> is distilling the same thing very often, by putting the distilled liquor upon the matter which remains in the bottom of the Still, and so drawing it off: it is done either to open better the substances, and volatilize them; or to fix the Spirits; and according to the quality of the matter, and the Artist's inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, this Operation is more or less reitera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:48577:16"/>
               <p>To <hi>Congele,</hi> is to suffer those Bodies to grow hard by cold, which fire before had melted and liquefied: This Operation is practised upon Metals, Minerals and Salts, which are purified by the violence of a melting fire, and when they are exposed to the air, grow hard. The same is observed in the fat of Animals, and in the gums, rozins, and balms of Vegetab es, which being melted by the fire, and their grosser parts thereby separated, are again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed, by being exposed to the cold air.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Corporize</hi> is to incorporate Spirits, which is often practised in <hi>Acids,</hi> which are mingled with fix'd Salts, or with dry Earths: As for example, when one puts the Spirit of <hi>Nitre</hi> or of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> with the fix'd Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> the last retains the first so strongly, that of them both one may make a good sort of <hi>Saltpeter;</hi> and likewise when one puts very strong Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, or some other acid Spirit upon Coral or Pearls, they presently retain all the acidity which the liquor contained, and it is fix'd with them.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Crystallize,</hi> is to reduce into Crystals, <hi>Nitre, Salts, Vitriols,</hi> and others, which were first dissolved, filtred, depurated, and evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, till a skin appeared upon the liquor; then they are exposed to the cold air, where the Salts congeal by little and little, and by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining some part of the water with which they had been dissolved, they appear diapha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous, and crystalline; which transparency they lose upon the least heat of the Sun, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:48577:16"/> them of their water, makes them opake again.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Detounation,</hi> or <hi>Fulminating,</hi> is the driving out of a Mineral its impure and volatile <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur,</hi> and preserving its intern and fix'd <hi>Sulphur:</hi> this Operation is performed by the means of <hi>Saltpeter,</hi> in preparing <hi>Antimony</hi> and other such bodies.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Digest,</hi> is to concoct things by a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate heat; like that of our stomachs, which concocts raw things, ripens and sweetens sour and austere ones, separates the pure parts from the impure, and extracts the best and most juicy parts of each substance. This Chymical Digestion is ordinarily perform'd by some li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor or <hi>menstruum</hi> fit for the matter digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; it differs from maceration only, because there is requir'd heat in one, which is not in the other.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Dissolve,</hi> is to reduce hard and compact bodies, by means of some dissolvents, into a liquid form, as we see in the dissolving of Gold by <hi>Aqua-regis,</hi> and of Silver and others by <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Edulcorate</hi> or <hi>Sweeten,</hi> is to take away by often lotions, and reiterated effusions of some liquor, the impression made by Salts and Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits in Chymical Preparations, as in Precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Magisteries and others.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Extinguish,</hi> or <hi>Quench,</hi> is to dip or steep a substance made red-hot by fire, in some wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; it is particularly practicable in Metals and Minerals; either to make them brittle, as in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:48577:17"/> the extinction of pibbles in water, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>print into them some vertue of those liquors in which they are extinguished, as in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of <hi>Tutie</hi> in Rose or Fennel-water; or sometimes to communicate vertue to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as in the extinction of Steel.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Evaporate</hi> and to <hi>Exhale</hi> differ from one another in this, that dry bodies are exhal'd, and moist ones evaporated; as for example, when we <hi>Amalgam</hi> any Metallick body, we exhale the <hi>Mercury</hi> by fire, and the Metal remains cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cin'd in the bottom of the Crucible. But Eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porations are done, as when for example, we drive away the superfluous humidity of Salts and Extracts; purified by their dissolutions and filtrations, to reduce them into a consistence necessary for their preservation.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Extract,</hi> is to separate in Animals and Vegetables the purest parts from the most gross, by fit <hi>menstruums</hi> that are proper for the extracting of those substances which the Artist desires: as for example, we extract the rozinous substance of <hi>Jalap</hi> by Spirit of Wine, because that the rozin is the sulphureous part of the <hi>Jalap;</hi> and that Spirit of Wine does likewise contain a subtil <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which easily unites with the other. So in all Extractions the Artist must have a regard to find out a <hi>menstru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um</hi> fitted to the substances he desires to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Ferment,</hi> is to reduce the <hi>volatile</hi> and spirituous parts of Mixts from rest into mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; or, as the Philosophers say, <hi>a potentia
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:48577:17"/> in actum,</hi> from power to act, by disengaging them from the clog of the more gross and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial parts, as is seen in all fermented li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, and particularly in Wine, which having been fermented, easily yields its spirit inflama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the least heat of fire; whereas the Must quite contrary retains all the spirituous and subtil sulphureous parts; and being reduced in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the consistence of Honey, which they call <hi>Sape, Rob,</hi> or <hi>Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>iddany,</hi> without loss of any sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, save insipid water, or flegm; its active and volatile parts are so well fastned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained by the fix'd Salts, that they seldom fly away but by the violence of fire, or the action of fermentation: it has much of the nature of digestion, except that digestion, I mean Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mical, is made by an external heat, and fermen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is by its own power and an effect of the intrinsick fire of Mixts.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Filtrate,</hi> is to let any thing strain through another body; it is performed most conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently thorow grey Cap-paper into a glass-tun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Fix,</hi> is to stay and retain some body which of its self is volatile, so as to make it resist the fire: this Operation is performed by the means of fix'd bodies. The experience may be made in <hi>Sal-armoniack,</hi> which, though extremely volatile, yet being mingled with quick-lime, is so fix'd, that the greatest part of it endures the violence of the fire, which alone it would not have done.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:48577:18"/>
               <p>To <hi>Fumigate,</hi> is to make any Mixt receive as it hangs in the air, the vapours of one or ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Mixts; to calcine it, or to correct some of its ill qualities, or impregnate it with some good one; as for example, we hang plates of lead over <hi>Mercury,</hi> which we cause to exhale in a Crucible upon the fire, in order to the calcining of them. We cause the smoke or vapour of <hi>Sulphur</hi> to be received by <hi>scam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony</hi> shread upon a sheet of paper, thereby to hinder its activity: we give likewise to well-wash'd moss the smoke of some spices, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by to perfume it.</p>

                  <hi>Fusion,</hi> vide <hi>Melt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>Granulate,</hi> is to pour out some molten Metal into cold water, to make it congeal to small grains or pellets, to make it by that divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion more fit for dissolution.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Levigate,</hi> is to bring a Mixt into an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palpable powder upon the Porphiry-stone, or Jaspar; and it is performed upon the most so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Mixts, particularly upon Minerals.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Liquify,</hi> is proper to all fat and grease of Animals, as likewise to wax, and all gums, and rozins, which is done by an easy heat, and they recover their consistency in the cold.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Melt,</hi> does belong only to Metals and Minerals, and is an Operation by which they are made running by the heat of fire; which we give strong or moderate, according to the nature of the Metal or Mineral we are about to melt.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Mortify,</hi> is to destroy the exterior form
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:48577:18"/> of the Mixt, which is done to <hi>Mercury;</hi> when you take away from him his fluidity and motion; the mixture of Salts and Spirits is likewise some mortification to them; for the one cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects the <hi>acrimony</hi> of the other.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Precipitate,</hi> is to separate a dissolv'd Mixt from its <hi>dissolvant,</hi> and make it fall in powder to the bottom. It is performed by th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> means of the Salts, which being put upon the dissolution, destroy the force and power of the <hi>dissolvant,</hi> and force him to forsake his hold of the Mixt, which he had already dissolved: as may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served in the precipitation of Coral and others.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Putrifie</hi> Bodies, is to dissolve them by a natural corruption, where moisture predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates over dryness.</p>
               <p>We rasp, saw, and file the more solid mixt Bodies, Vegetable, Animal, and Mineral, the better to open them, or to facilitate their dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution or preparation: these Operations need no farther explication.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Rectify,</hi> is to distill the Spirits of any thing over again, to make them more subtil, and heighten their vertues.</p>

This same close fire of <hi>Reverberation</hi> is likewise in use, to drive up the Spirits and the Oils by a Retort; it is called a fire of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verberation,</hi> because the heat of the fire doth reverberate, and from all sides reflect and act upon the matter, or the vessel containing it.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Revive,</hi> is opposite to the term of mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying; since by this Operation, <hi>Mercury,</hi> which has been reduced into <hi>Sublimate, Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naber, Precipitate,</hi> and other such <hi>Foraces,</hi> is brought into a <hi>Quicksilver</hi> again, as it shall be shewed in its due place.</p>
               <p>To <hi>Spiritualize,</hi> is to reduce compact Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies into thinner and more subtil ones, such as Spirits are, as is practised upon Salts, which by distilation may be entirely forc'd into Spirits, and the same Spirits shall not take body again without the addition of some substance fit to retain them.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the variety of Vessels which serve for Chymical Operations.</head>
               <p>TO perform Chymical Operations, one must be very well provided with necessary In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments and Vessels; for there being but few things that can be prepared in an open naked fire, one is obliged to put ones matter into
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:48577:20"/> some convenient Vessel, which is to be placed with dexterity upon the fire, and that is to be governed differently, according to the Artist's skill and intention.</p>
               <p>These Vessels are to be considered either ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their matter, or their form: their matter is to be of some pure, close substance, not easily penetrable, and which likewise may not communicate its qualities to the Medicine prepared; such as are particularly Potters-Earth and Stone, Brass and Tin may sometimes serve in distillations and preparations of Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables. But it is necessary to tin all Brass and Copper-Vessels, that they may not so easily communicate their <hi>Vitriolick</hi> quality hurtful to Medicaments.</p>
               <p>The shape and form of Chymical Vessels is almost infinite, therefore we will speak only of those which are necessary in a Chymical Labo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory, leaving every man to his liberty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent those which he judges proper to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign. First, Gourds or Bodies either of Glass or Earth, with their Heads or <hi>Alem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>icks,</hi> which are placed in the <hi>Balneum Mariae</hi> either of Sand or Ashes, for all distillations <hi>per ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum,</hi> by ascent; then we make use of the <hi>Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sica,</hi> or Brass Body or Gourd, with its Head or Refrigeratory tinn'd within, and fill'd on the top with cold water, which one must often change during the Distillation; likewise the other Brass <hi>Vesica</hi> or Body, with the <hi>Mores<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,</hi> and a Pipe passing through an Hogshead of water, is very useful in the distilling of such
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:48577:20"/>
                  <hi>Aromatick</hi> Oils of Vegetables as are heavy, such as are the Oils of <hi>Cinnamon, Rose, Wood, Cloves,</hi> and others of that nature which fall down to the bottom of the water, and do ascend with difficulty in an high <hi>Refrigera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To distill such herbs as not being <hi>Aromatick,</hi> have their vertue consisting in their kind; <hi>Salt,</hi> a <hi>Cucurbite</hi> Gourd or Body, large, low, and capacious, is best; it may be of Brass, but its <hi>Lembick</hi> or Head must be of Pewter; and this must be placed in the Sand Furnace represented here in the third Table.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Retorts</hi> are used in all Distillations that are made on the side, or sidelong, <hi>per lacus.</hi> Artists have invented this Vessel for such matters as in distilling do not easily send their vapours up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards.</p>
               <p>As for that Operation which is called Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling by descent, we have Earthen-Pots that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into one another; the lowermost must be set in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:48577:21"/> about the Pot, which is above ground, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it till it be red-hot; thus the fire acting upon the wood liquifies those parts of it that may be liquified, and sends them through the holes of the <hi>pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

               <p>
                  <hi>Matrasses</hi> or <hi>Bolts-heads</hi> are likewise very good to digest and extract.</p>
               <p>There is a sort of double <hi>Bolts-heads,</hi> when the neck of one <hi>Matrasse</hi> or <hi>Bolts-head</hi> is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serted into the neck of the other: the lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most containing the matter, and the uppermost receiving the Spirits, and sending them down again, that they may the better open and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gest the substances they come from. This Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel is used in our most excellent Operations, and for very subtil matters.

               <p>We cannot be without the use of <hi>Aludels,</hi> and subliming-Pots made of different pieces placed and inserted upon into one another: the matter to be sublim'd, is contained in the <hi>Alu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del,</hi> or lowermost Pot, of a different figure from the others, as may be seen in the Table here represented; the pots that are on the top, do enter into one another, but must be carefully luted in their joints, and bored through, to give way to the flowers that rise, except the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most, which must be covered, and is a sort of blind Head, and in which, after you have gently unluted the Vessels, you find a great part of the flowers sticking, as in the other, and the higher the Vessels are, the purer the Flowers; and those which rise to the top are always the best, and so downwards, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Of the Construction and variety of <hi>FURNACES</hi>
               </head>
               <p>AS <hi>Chymists</hi> cannot be without Vessels to contain their Matters, so neither is it possible for them to work thereon according to their purposes, unless those Vessels them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves be so placed by some ingenious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance that the Fire may be increased, aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and governed as shall be needful. And to say truth, they have been but too ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in inventing these <hi>Furnaces</hi> having encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed many infinity of diverse proportions and figures, not considering the simplicity of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, even to confusion. This has made great Artists make use but of one <hi>Furnace</hi> for all their Operations, imitating in that Nature, which as much as it can is single, and delights in uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, not multiplying any Instrument without ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessity. But nevertheless, because there may be occasion of making the same Operations upon the like matter at the same time, and likewise because that in building dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent <hi>Furnaces</hi> according to the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of Fire, one may with more exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:48577:25"/> compass one's intention; we have thought fit to deliver the way of raising different <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naces,</hi> and amongst them the Construction of one which may serve in a need for all necessary uses.</p>
               <p>And <hi>First,</hi> Before we speak of their form, or figure, we will deliver the Matter they are to be made of, as well those that are Portative, as the fix'd ones.</p>
               <p>The fix'd ones must be built of Brick, and that Clay or Earth, with which Bakers make their Ovens, which must be well mingled and kneaded with a third part of Horse-dung.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Portative,</hi> or movable <hi>Furnaces</hi> are to be made of Potters Earth, and Potsheards beaten together to Powder, and well mixed with the Earth, thus are made Crucibles, and other Vessels, that must endure much Fire.</p>
               <p>Every <hi>Furnace</hi> must be divided into four parts and sometimes into five. The <hi>First</hi> is, the Ash-hole, with it's door. The <hi>Second</hi> is the Grate. The <hi>Third</hi> is the Fire-hole, with its door. And the <hi>Fourth</hi> is the place that the Vessel is to be set in: In which space there ought to be four Holes or Registers, by the opening or shutting of which the fire is to be governed. The <hi>Fif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h,</hi> when necessary is, the <hi>Domo</hi> or <hi>Cupola</hi> over the Vessel which stops up the Registers, and therefore in their room must have a Hole in the top to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened and shut as the Registers were.</p>
               <p>We shall now begin by describing that
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:48577:25"/>
                  <hi>Furnace,</hi> which the Artists have named <hi>Piger Henricus,</hi> or, <hi>Slothful Harry;</hi> so called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it requires not to be so exactly looked to, and watched as other <hi>Furn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ces</hi> do. It is called likewise <hi>Athano<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>,</hi> which in <hi>Arabian</hi> signifies a <hi>Furnace;</hi> it is so called for its ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence, because it is very useful to perform many Operations at once, save Coals, and to refresh the Artist, because the heat which the Tower communicates to the neighbouring parts may be easily governed.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Furnace</hi> has three parts. The <hi>First,</hi> is the Tower, which contains the Fire, and as much Coals as can be consumed by it in 24 hours. The <hi>Second</hi> is a <hi>Furnace</hi> for the <hi>Balneum Mariae:</hi> and the <hi>Third</hi> a <hi>Sand Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>:</hi> and if the place be big enough one should add a <hi>Furnace</hi> with Ashes. The first part, which is the Tower ought to be at least three Foot high and eight or nine Inches in its diameter, round within and very smooth, it must have it's Ash-hole with its door to take out the Ashes; it must likewise have a grate, and under it another door, by which one may make clean the Tower, in case it be foul: a collection of Stones, Earth, or other impurity happening amongst the Coals, which ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> stop the Grate and hinder the Fire. The Tower must have on each side a little above the Grate, a hole of about five Inches high, and four Inches wide, by which the heat of the Tower may be communicated to the <hi>Balneum Mariae Furnace,</hi> and to the <hi>Sand
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:48577:26"/> Furnace;</hi> which may likewise have their Ash-holes, or Grates by themselves, that so by put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in Coals they may be heated, without heating the whole Tower; they must like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise have their Registers: one may likewise fix an earthen Pan upon the top of the Tower over the hole by which the Coals are put in, and lute it well, and so filling it with Sand or Ashes, one may place it a Vessel either for Distilling or Circulating.</p>
               <p>There is another sort of <hi>Furnace</hi> for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestions in which one may likewise perform many other operations at the same time, and save Coals; its Figure is in the third Table, it is composed of three Parts or <hi>Furnaces,</hi> joyned to one another by stories. The First, which is that which contains the Fire, is made of an Ash-hole and its door, a Grate, and Fire-hole, of a space to contain Coals enough to maintain an equal Fire for twelve hours, and of a <hi>Capsula,</hi> or Vessel to contain Sand, in which are put the Glasses or other Vessels for the Operation; all the difference between this <hi>Furnace</hi> and others is, that instead of the four Registers, one at each corner, there is an overture or hole within, by which the heat is communicated to the second <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> joyned to this, and from thence to the third. In the <hi>First</hi> one may Distil by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torts; in the <hi>Second</hi> by <hi>Cucurbites,</hi> with their <hi>Limbeck</hi> heads; and the <hi>Third</hi> is for Digesti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Extractions, and other such Operations: and yet the expence is no greater than for one
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:48577:26"/>
                  <hi>Furnace:</hi> for whereas the heat of the Fire in ordinary <hi>Furnaces</hi> is lost, through the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gisters, here it is retained and communicated from <hi>Furnace</hi> to <hi>Furnace;</hi> they that have room enough may add a <hi>Furnace</hi> or two more, and by the same Fire make five or six sorts of degrees of heat.</p>
               <p>There is required a <hi>Furnace</hi> by it self for the Brass <hi>Vesica,</hi> with its Refrigeratory, or Moors head to Distil and rectify in it Spirit of Wine, and the Spirits of other fermented Vegetables, as likewise to Distil Aromatick Oyls.</p>
               <p>A Furnace of close Reverberatory is necessary for the Distilling of <hi>Aqua Fortis, Spirit of Salt, Niter, Vitriol</hi> and others: and the same <hi>Furnace</hi> may serve to Calcine and Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Metals and Minerals, it ought to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed of five parts. The First is the Ash-hole; the Second, the Grate; the Third the place where the Fire is put in; the Fourth, is, the space which contains the Retorts, or other Vessels, which rest upon two Iron bars; and Lastly, there is a Cover either round or square, which Reverberates the Fire. And there is is another flat Cover to be used when one is to Reverberate any thing with a flaming Fire of Wood.</p>
               <p>Besides this <hi>Furnace,</hi> Artists have another <hi>Furnace</hi> of Reverberation, very fit for Calcina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Reverberations of Metals and Mine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, which are to be reduced to <hi>Crocus</hi>'s or Impalpable Powders by the force of the Fire.
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:48577:27"/> Its Figure is in the third Table, it is ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily made of three parts. The first is to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Wood; the second and third are for the things to be operated upon, which when they are done by the flame of Wood, are spread upon thin Iron-plates, or upon Tiles; one may add the fourth, fifth, and sixth Story, the flame going Serpent-wise from one Story to another.</p>
               <p>One must have a <hi>Wind-Furnace</hi> for melting of Minerals and Metals, and for <hi>Vitrification;</hi> the Ash-hole of this <hi>Furnace</hi> must be pretty high, and the Overture wide, that the wind may enter with ease.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Furnace</hi> ought to be round within, it is made large or small, according to the quantity of matter you intend to melt: over the Grate there must be a door for the Charcoal to be put in. The Fire-hearth must be about a foot-high, and covered with a strong covering of good Crucible-Earth, consisting of two pieces, that so the one half may be taken off when a Crucible is to be placed in, or removed from the fire. This covering must be made in form of an half-Globe, having an hole in the top, in which may be thrust one, two, or three Pipes, one upon another, for the better concen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating of the heat about the Crucible. This very <hi>Furnace</hi> may also serve for the Sublima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Antimony</hi> and other Minerals, by ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king away the Covering, and placing an Iron-Bar cross the fire-place, whereon to set the Vessel containing the matter to be sublim'd.</p>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:48577:27"/>
               <p>Now for the ease of those who will not, or cannot have a great Laboratory, I will describe an <hi>Ʋniversal Furnace,</hi> serving for all Chymical Operations, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi> consists of one single piece, besides the Covering, and of very good crucible-Earth; after it is made and dry'd, it must be bak'd in some Potter's <hi>Furnace;</hi> by which means it will last a mans life. The height of the Ash-hole must be six Inches, with a door for drawing forth the Ashes, and giving Air to the Fire. The Iron Grate must be plac'd over it for the Fire to lye on. The inside of the <hi>Furnace</hi> must be narrow downwards in form of a Scuttle, to the end the Grate may rest on it; and wide upwards. The Fire-place must be nine Inches in height, to the place where two Iron Bars are to be set for sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the Vessels.

                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:48577:28"/> may be greater or lesser, according as the Artist is minded to work upon little or much matter. He must not forget to make four holes in the top of the <hi>Furnace,</hi> to serve for <hi>Registers</hi> in those Operations in which the round Head or <hi>Cupolo</hi> is not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary; as also four Stopples wherewith to shut and open the said Registers, as well as two others to serve for the like use to the doors of the Fire-place and Ash-hole; which is to be observed in all sorts of <hi>Furnaces.</hi> When you are minded to distill <hi>in Balneo,</hi> you must get a round Kettle proportionable to the opening of the <hi>Furnace,</hi> and so likewise a <hi>Vesica</hi> of Copper of the same proportion, or what other Vessel you think good to employ for rectifying the burning Spirits of Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getables. For distilling in Sand, you must have a good Earth of the like proporti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, wherein to put the Sand. For Reverbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, place the Retort upon the Iron Bars, and cover it with the round Head or <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When you would Calcine or melt, take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the Iron Bars, that you may let the Pot down upon a little round Plate, which is to be put upon the Grate.</p>
               <p>I omit here to speak of the <hi>Lamp-Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace,</hi> because it is not useful in a course of Chymistry which allows not time for long preparations, as those of this <hi>Furnace</hi> are.

                  <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the Lutings of Furnaces and Vessels.</head>
               <p>'TIS not enough to have spoken of the diversity of Vessels, and of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of <hi>Furnaces;</hi> 'tis also fit that the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tist know how to manage, cut, and adjust them one with another; and in case of need, if he cannot make all the Vessels, he must learn to make part of them, as Crucibles, Pans, with other Fire-vessels, and likewise all the matter of his <hi>Furnaces.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Paste</hi> for Portable <hi>Furnaces</hi> is composed of fat Earth, or Potters-clay, and of broken Pots grosly powdered, which commonly they call Cement. You must take two parts of fat Earth, dry it, and powder it; and three parts of the said Cement in powder. Mix them well, and with water make a Paste, of which form your <hi>Furnaces;</hi> dry them first in the shadow, and afterwards bake them in a Potters <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace.</hi> Observe that when the Earth is extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fat, the quantity of Cement must be aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, lest the <hi>Furnaces</hi> cleave in drying; which will happen, unless sufficient quantity of powder of broken Pots be added.</p>
               <pb facs="tcp:48577:35"/>
               <p>This very composition of Earth may also serve for the construction of <hi>Aludels, Pans, Gourds, Crucibles,</hi> and other Vessels destinated to the violence of the fire; which they will resist, provided you take care to make the powder of broken Pots finer than for <hi>Furnaces.</hi> You must also let them dry gently, and then bake them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Paste</hi> or <hi>Lute</hi> for immovable <hi>Furnaces</hi> must be made of two thirds of that Earth with which Bakers make their Ovens, and one third of Horse-dung well cleansed and sifted, which must be tempered with water, and well wrought together. This Paste set in a Cellar in a Tub, putrifies, and becomes so managable, that it may with great ease be employed for the conjunction of the Bricks, wherewith we ordinarily build fix'd Furnaces, which must be thick, as well to preserve the heat, as to last a long time.</p>
               <p>As for the luting of <hi>Retorts,</hi> whether of Glass or Earth, which are to be exposed to a violent fire, as also for luting and joining the <hi>Recipients</hi> with the <hi>Retorts,</hi> take ten parts of the above-mentioned putrified Paste, one part of the flakes of Iron, one part of powdered Glass, two parts of the <hi>Caput-mortuum</hi> of <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> beaten to powder, and incorporate them well all together.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Cohobation</hi> or <hi>Rectification</hi> of Spirits or <hi>Aethereal</hi> Oils, there is nothing better to keep them from evaporating, than the bladder of an Hog or Ox, applied wet round about the
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:48577:35"/> joining of the Gourd to the <hi>Alembick,</hi> and that of the <hi>Alembick</hi> to the <hi>Recipient.</hi> It also serves for joining double Vessels; for as it dries, it makes a kind of Glew, which becomes hard, and by that means binds the Vessels per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecty well together. But note that Corrosive Spirits consume the bladder in a moment, and then fly away. To retain their Spirits, use the following lute.</p>
               <p>Take Wheat-flower, and unslak'd-Lime powdered, and with the white of an Egg make them into a Paste, which apply presently to the joints with a fine rag. The cracks of <hi>Recipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents</hi> and other Vessels may be mended with this Lute, provided some <hi>Minium</hi> or <hi>Litharge</hi> powdered, be mix'd with it.</p>
               <p>Sometimes the neck of the Vessel, which is to be set for digestion, is stopt by the melting of it; this they call <hi>Hermetical Sealing,</hi> and it is practised in <hi>Pelicans,</hi> and long-neck'd Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels. When the materials are put into them, a Charcoal-fire is applied round about the neck of the Vessel; which fire must be kindled with discretion, to the end the Glass may be heated by little and little, without breaking. Then the fire is to be encreased till the Glass melt, which must in that condition be wreathed with hot tongs, till there remain no hole at all.</p>
               <p>But in as much as such Vessels are used but seldom, especially the <hi>Pelicans,</hi> and this sort of luting renders them incapable of serving more than once; you may make a Paste of a mixture of <hi>Mastich, Venice-Glass</hi> powdered, <hi>Borax,</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:48577:36"/> and the white of an Egg, with which Vessels may be stopt, and let the same dry with a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle heat. Afterwards melt this Lute with a small Reed at the flame of a Lamp. You may also seal <hi>Hermetically</hi> with a Lamp thin Glass-Vessels, which have a narrow mouth, and long neck.</p>

                  <hi>CHAP. X.</hi> Of the degrees of Fire.</head>
               <p>THE Furnaces being built, and the Vessels provided, and luted (such as require it) the next thing is to make choice of, and to manage the Fire suitably to the matter you work upon. To this purpose 'tis fit to know what Fires are more or less violent. The gent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lest of all is the <hi>Balneum Vaporis,</hi> which is, to hang the Vessel containing the matter, just over the <hi>Balneum Mariae,</hi> that so it may receive the steams of the water, which may be heated more or less even to boiling.</p>
               <p>The next degree of heat is the <hi>Balneum Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riae,</hi> which consists in placing the Vessel con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the matter, in another Vessel contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing water; which may be kept either <hi>tepid</hi> or boiling, as occasion requires. But lest the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter lift up, and overturn the Vessel, as it will
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:48577:36"/> be apt to do, especially when there is but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle matter within it; and also lest the bottom of the Vessel touch the bottom of the Bath, and endanger the breaking of it; 'tis usual to fasten to the bottom of the Vessel a circle of Lead environ'd with straw, to serve as a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoise to the Vessel, and to secure it from touching.</p>
               <p>The next Heat is that of Ashes, improperly term'd a <hi>Ba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>h;</hi> which Ashes must be sifted, and put into an earthen-Pan that resists the Fire. Place the Vessel in these Ashes as deep as the matter it contains. The Heat of Sand follows next, as being a degree beyond the former; 'tis improperly called a <hi>Bath,</hi> but is ordered after the same manner.</p>
               <p>Filings of Iron come next, and afford a greater heat than Sand.</p>
               <p>The close <hi>Reverberatory</hi> Fire follows; it serves for drawing of Spirits, and is made with Charcoal.</p>
               <p>The last is the Flaming-Fire, or Fire of <hi>Fusion;</hi> 'tis the most violent of all, and is made with Wood, but sometimes too with Charcoal, for <hi>Calcining</hi> and <hi>Reverberating</hi> things.</p>
               <p>Each of these sorts of Fire hath its degrees, especially the Violent, as well by encreasing the Fewel, as by opening the <hi>Registers.</hi> Hence you are directed to a Fire of the first, second, third and fourth degree, especially in the Distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of Spirits.</p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:48577:37"/>
               <p>Besides these, there are the <hi>Lamp,</hi> the <hi>Dung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hil,</hi> the <hi>Burning-Glass,</hi> and others; of which, for brevity-sake, I shall say nothing; because those already mentioned serve for all the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations intended in this Treatise.</p>

               <hi>A TREATISE OF <hi>Chymistry.</hi> Book II.</hi> Certain Remarks preliminary to the following Prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</head>
            <p>IN the First Part of this Treatise we have spoken in few words what seemed neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary concerning the Names, Usefulness, and Definition of Chymistry; as also concerning its Object, Matter, and Functions. We have
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:48577:38"/> also spoken of its Principles, and the several Operations whereby the same may be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and purified. We have likewise described the Figures of Vessels, and their Variety; the construction and matter of <hi>Furnaces,</hi> the diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity of <hi>Lutings;</hi> and lastly, the manner of giving and graduating Fire; without the action whereof, all the rest would be useless. These Generals will not perplex the mind, and yet they will afford a Theory sufficient for Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice; to which we shall now proceed.</p>
            <p>But before we enter upon it, our End being to propose plainly all the Preparations as well in Writing as in Working, we have thought fit to acquaint the curious Reader with certain Remarks, of great moment both to his Design and ours. Inasmuch therefore as natural Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are infinite in number, and very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent in substance and form, both internal and external, great variety of means and instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments must be employed as well to open them as to separate their parts. For Metals and Minerals require to be handled other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise than Vegetables and Animals; and even the preparation of Metals and Minerals is different according as they are more or less perfect, compact or porous, fixt or volatile. For example, the Oils of Vegetables are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable to dissolve or extract the Sulphurs of Minerals; but the extraction or dissolution of some is much more easie than that of others. As we see, common Oil will totally dissolve common Sulphur, if they be put to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:48577:38"/> upon the Fire; and that because of the great correspondence that the Sulphurs of Minerals have with the Oils of Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. Lead, which hath acquired a greater perfection than common Sulphur, needs help, and cannot be united with Oil unless it be reduced into Powder, Calx, or Litharge; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, its whole substance easily incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porates with Oyl, by means of the Fire and a gentle agitation. This gives us to know, that Lead is almost nothing else but Sulphur, and a terrestrial Salt. For if it contain'd much Mercury, Oils having no correspondence there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with, could not dissolve it totally as they do. Which remark may serve to undeceive certain curious persons, who accounting Lead more perfect than it is, eagerly seek for Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury in its Body. Which I advise them well to consider.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Antimony</hi> is a Mineral, which contains in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self much <hi>Sulphur,</hi> indigested, and dissolvable in Oil as well as common <hi>Sulphur.</hi> For 'tis a <hi>Sulphur</hi> superficially joined to the <hi>Antimony.</hi> Nevertheless, if <hi>Antimony</hi> be not opened by <hi>Sublimation,</hi> and reduced into Flowers, or an <hi>Alkool,</hi> 'tis impossible to make a Dissolution of it. But being reduced into that state, Oil pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrates it, and joins it self with its sulphure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous part, leaving the rest apart, which could not in any wise abandon that sulphureous part of the <hi>Antimony,</hi> before it was so re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <pb n="50" facs="tcp:48577:39"/>
            <p>By these Examples of common <hi>Sulphur, Lead</hi> and <hi>Antimony,</hi> 'tis easy to understand, that the more compact or perfect a Metal is, the more it ought to be opened and disposed to the separation of its superficial <hi>Sulphur;</hi> I speak not of that which is internal and essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, since we believe Metals indivisible; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less any man will pretend to reduce them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Principles, or several substances by the <hi>Alkahest</hi> or universal <hi>Dissolvent,</hi> of which I shall not discourse here, for fear of offending some, who think they possess it, and yet have not even good particular <hi>Dissolvents,</hi> or of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing esteemed too incredulous by those that seek it. If we should say that 'tis hard to imagine how a Liquor without <hi>Corrosion</hi> can resolve all Sublunary Bodies into their true Principles, without any reaction on their part; and how this <hi>Dissolvent</hi> should diminish neither in weight nor vertue, but have as much strength after a thousand Dissolutions, as in the first; as <hi>Van Helmont</hi> discourses of it. Wherefore wanting this mystery, we maintain, that whatsoever form is given to Metals by the ordinary Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solutions, which are properly <hi>Corr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>sions,</hi> they remain always reducible into their first sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, with little or no alteration. So the Essences or Tinctures, and the Oils pretended to be drawn from Metals, are, to speak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly, nothing but Metallick Substances dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guised by the division of their integral parts, and by their union with the <hi>Dissolvents;</hi> but so that they may be separated from the same,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:48577:39"/> and reduced into Metallick Bodies, in the same form which they possessed before they were dissolved.</p>
            <p>And upon this occasion we might say some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing further against those who boast of pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessing the true <hi>Tincture</hi> or <hi>Essence</hi> of Gold, its <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and its <hi>Mercury</hi> irreducible into a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallick Body. In a word, who think they have the true Potable Gold, of which they tell wonders, and by which they pretend to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all sorts of Diseases, and to make men live as long as the first Patriarcks. This sort of People are more diseased themselves, than they whom they pretend to Cure, and were more worthy of pitty than punishment, if there were not some persons credulous enough to believe their promises, and to lose their Time, Estate, Health and Life, by the imposture of these Ignorants. This is the source of the Scandals cast upon true Chymistry; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing well considered, is found most worthy to be cultivated.</p>
            <p>This by the way. Now, since Metals and Minerals are so different, there is requisite al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most to every one in particular, not only a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Preparation, but to overy Preparation a great labour both of Body and Mind, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of proceeding wholly distinct: which is the reason that general Rules for their Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration cannot be establish'd, as there may be for that of Vegetables and Animals. Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless, they cannot be reduced without some Salts, Oils, or Spirits. But most Vegetables
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:48577:40"/> need no addition, yet require different Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations as well as Minerals. For sometimes we design to reduce them distinctly into their five substances; sometimes we desire but one of them. For Example; we are contented to draw only the rozinous substance of <hi>Jallap,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting the other substances as useless. We draw by Distillation the essential Oil of <hi>Anise,</hi> and preserve the same carefully, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garding the remainder. Sometimes we <hi>Calcine Tartar,</hi> to draw out the fixt Salt, without minding its sulphureous and <hi>mercurial</hi> parts, which are suffered to exhale or evaporate by the violence of the fire. When we extract the volatile Salt of <hi>Ʋrine,</hi> we trouble not our selves aboutt the other Principles; as when we have made the Jelly of <hi>Harts-horn,</hi> we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject all the rest; and so of infinite others.</p>
            <p>Vegetables entire, or their parts, which we desire to reduce into their solid Principles, hard or dry, as Roots, Barks, Gums, Seeds, Fruits, Leaves, &amp;c. are first rasp'd or cut in pieces, or else powdered grosly, so as to be put into a <hi>Retort,</hi> which is placed in a <hi>Reverberatory</hi> fire, by means whereof comes into the <hi>Reci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pient,</hi> first the Flegm, next the Spirit, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Oil. But the fixt Salt and Earth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the <hi>Retort,</hi> and are separated after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards by <hi>Dissolutions, Filtrations</hi> and <hi>Coagu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The parts of Vegetables which are in a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid form, as <hi>Must,</hi> and other juices, before their <hi>Fermentation,</hi> are distill'd by an <hi>Alembick</hi>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:48577:40"/> in a fire of Sand, and yield first a quantity of Flegm, next the Spirit, and afterwards the Oil, leaving the Earth and Salt in the bottom of the <hi>Alembick.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If you desire to draw the five substances of fermented Liquors, as Wine, Cider, Hydromel, Beer, and the like; whereas those which are not fermented, send out the Flegm first; these send first their subtil and inflammable Spirit, and afterwards the Flegm; then they yield a Spirit and Oil smelling of burning, and leave the fix'd Salt and Earth in the bottom.</p>
            <p>Liquors which have pass'd a Fermentation even to a kind of corruption, as Vinegar of Wine, Beer, Cider, and others, render their Flegm first, then an <hi>acid</hi> Spirit, afterwards a Spirit, and <hi>foetid</hi> Oil, leaving the Salt and Earth in the bottom.</p>
            <p>Animals entire, or their parts, if dry, are cut into pieces, or reduced to a course Powder, in order to their being put into the <hi>Retort.</hi> If their parts be liquid, as Blood, Urine, &amp;c. they are put into an <hi>Alembick.</hi> Both these Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels are set in a fire of Sand, by means where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of you draw first the Flegm, then Spirit, and volatile Salt, with a stinking Oil: and in-as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as this Spirit and volatile Salt abound in Animals, they raise up the fix'd Salt, and carry it with them; so that the Earth remains alone in the bottom of the Vessel.</p>
            <p>Having thus destroy'd the first form of mix'd Bodies, you separate the Principles, each by it self. The Oil is separated from the Spirit
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:48577:41"/> and Flegm by a Tunnel; the Spirit is separated from the Flegm by <hi>Rectification;</hi> and the Salt by <hi>Elixation</hi> and <hi>Filtration</hi> from the <hi>Caput-mortuum,</hi> or <hi>Terra-damnata,</hi> as we shall shew more clearly in due place.</p>

                  <p>WE shall begin with <hi>Gold,</hi> which is the most pure, fix'd, compact, and weighty of all Metals, rendered so by the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Salt, Sulphur,</hi> and <hi>Mercury,</hi> equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested, and purified to the highest point. Hence it is justly called the King of Metals, as being the most perfect of all. 'Tis called also the Sun, as well for the resemblance it hath with the Sun of the great World which enlightens us; as for that it hath with the heart of man, which is the Sun of the little World. Its co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour is yellow, tending towards red. I will not stand to enquire what place affords the best; since the Artist ought to know how to separate and free it from other Metals that are found mix'd with it either in the Mines, or
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:48577:42"/> by the fraud of men; and that all <hi>Gold</hi> is good when 'tis alone, and separated from other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals.</p>
                  <p>We will begin with its Purification, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of there are four ways. The first is, the <hi>Cup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple</hi> with <hi>Lead.</hi> The second, <hi>Cementation</hi> in a <hi>Crucible.</hi> The third, by <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi> And the fourth, and most certain of all, is, the Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by <hi>Antimony.</hi>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:48577:42"/> and carry with it the other imperfect Metals mixt with the <hi>Gold,</hi> which will become pure within the <hi>Cupple,</hi> and of an high colour; except the <hi>Gold</hi> be mixt with some portion of Silver, which resists the action of the <hi>Lead</hi> as well as the <hi>Gold;</hi> in which case you must have recourse to <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> or <hi>Antimony.</hi>

The reason of this is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Copper being less compact, and more earthy than the Silver, is easily penetrated by that corrosive Spirit, which impetuously falling upon this morsel, as agreeable to its appetite, it quits its first hold, and takes up to the Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per which it last met with, and devours as much of it as it can retain. This blue water impregnated with Copper, must be pour'd off by inclination, and kept in an earthen Vessel; 'tis called <hi>the second water,</hi> and Chirurgeons use
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:48577:44"/> it for <hi>Cancers,</hi> and other outward <hi>Ʋlcers.</hi> The Silver is found in the bottom. It must be wash'd, dry'd, and kept (if you please) in form of a <hi>Calx,</hi> or else reduc'd into an <hi>Ingot</hi> in a <hi>Crucible,</hi> with a little Salt of <hi>Tartar.</hi> But if into this second water, which is properly a <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution</hi> of Copper, you put a body more earthy and porous than Copper, as Iron is, the Copper precipitates, and the <hi>Corrosive</hi> Spirits of the <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> fasten to the substance of Iron; which may likewise be precipitated by some Mineral more earthy and porous than Iron, as <hi>Lapis Calaminaris</hi> and <hi>Zink.</hi> Lastly, if you pour into this Liquor charg'd with these Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances some of the Liquor of fix'd <hi>Nitre,</hi> drop by drop, this latter will destroy the <hi>aci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity</hi> of the <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> and precipitate those Minerals. Note, that if you evaporate and crystallize the Liquor, you will draw from it very good <hi>Saltpeter,</hi> reincorporated with its fixt Salt, from which those Spirits at first were distilled.</p>
                     <p>These last Experiments might seem imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent to this Chapter of <hi>Gold.</hi> But our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to instruct the Curious, made us take oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casion to mention them from the Purifying of that Metal by <hi>Aqua-fortis.</hi> And they are not unuseful to open the way to others more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderable.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THis is the best way of all; for Lead car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries away only the imperfect Metals, but leaves Silver join'd with <hi>Gold. Cement</hi> often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times leaves the <hi>Gold</hi> impure, and consumes some part of it. <hi>Aqua-fortis</hi> is not always a certain trial of the pureness of <hi>Gold:</hi> for sometimes it happens that <hi>Gold</hi> having been mixt with some sulphureous matters, their odour involves some of the Silver which had been put to the <hi>Gold,</hi> to cleanse it by <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> which Silver falls down, and is precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated with the <hi>Gold</hi> at the parting, thereby giving surprising and short joys to the unskil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, who are apt to think presently they have found out the way to encrease <hi>Gold:</hi> but upon further examination they find their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion deceived. On the other side, you may be certain, that <hi>Gold</hi> which hath past the trial by <hi>Antimony</hi> is throughly purged, and freed from all mixture. For nothing but <hi>Gold</hi> is able to resist that devouring Wolf.</p>
                     <p>Take therefore an ounce of <hi>Gold,</hi> such as the Goldsmiths use; put it into a <hi>Crucible</hi> amongst burning-coals in a wind-Furnace, and when it is very red, put to it by little and little four ounces of good <hi>Antimony</hi> in powder, which will melt immediately, and at the same
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:48577:45"/> time devour the <hi>Gold,</hi> (which otherwise is of very difficult <hi>Fusion,</hi> by reason of its most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act composition:) when the whole is melted like water, and the matter sparkles, 'tis a sign that the <hi>Antimony</hi> is at work upon the impurities of the <hi>Gold.</hi> Wherefore leave it a little upon the fire; then cast it nimbly into an Iron-<hi>Crucible,</hi> which has been to that end before heated, and smear'd with a little Oil. When the matter is pour'd in, strike the <hi>Crucible</hi> with the Tongs, to make the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulus</hi> descend to the bottom. After 'tis a little cool'd, separate the <hi>Regulus</hi> from the dross. Weigh it, and put it to melt in a good large <hi>Crucible,</hi> adding to it by little and little double its weight of <hi>Saltpeter:</hi> then cover the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible;</hi> so that the coals get not into it, and gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving a quick fire, the <hi>Saltpeter</hi> consumes all that remain'd of the <hi>Antimony</hi> with the <hi>Gold;</hi> and the <hi>Gold</hi> settles at the bottom of a most beautiful colour, and pure. You may put it into a <hi>Crucible</hi> hot at it is, or else let the <hi>Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible</hi> cool, and then break it to separate the <hi>Ingot</hi> from the Salts. This manner of purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Regulus</hi> of <hi>Gold</hi> is not common and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary, but preferable before the rest, because done speedily: but 'tis practised only in a small quantity. The common fashion is, to put the <hi>Gold</hi> in a flat <hi>Crucible</hi> upon a melting fire, and blow continually till the <hi>Antimonial</hi> part be exhaled. This not only requires time, but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses you to the hurtful exhalations of the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony,</hi> which 'tis always good to avoid.</p>

                     <p>REduce into thin plates a dram of fine <hi>Gold;</hi> put these plates into a <hi>Matrass,</hi> and pour on them three drams of good <hi>Aqua-regia,</hi> then set the Matrass upon hot Sand, till the <hi>Gold</hi> be dissolv'd. Pour the <hi>Solution</hi> into a Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel wherein there is three or four ounces or more of Fountain-water; then pour to it drop by drop some Oil of <hi>Tartar</hi> made by <hi>Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quation</hi> till the <hi>Ebullition</hi> ceases; which is a sign that the <hi>Corrosion</hi> of the <hi>Aqua-Regia</hi> is destroyed by the Liquor of the Salt <hi>Alkali</hi> of <hi>Tartar,</hi> which, as other <hi>Alkalies,</hi> breaks the force of <hi>Corrosive</hi> Spirits, so that they are constrained to let fall to the bottom the body which they held in form of Liquor. The same happens here to the <hi>Gold:</hi> for if you let it set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle a-while, it will precipitate it self to the bottom of the water; which will swim above as clear as Crystal, and is to be pour'd off by inclination. You must pour warm water upon the powder, to take away all the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the Salts; and when 'tis setled, pour that wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter off, and put more upon it. This do so often, till the powder of <hi>Gold</hi> be well edulcorated; which is known by its being insipid. Lastly, put it into a Tunnel with filtring paper, through which the Liquor passes, and leaves behind it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:48577:46"/> the powder of <hi>Gold,</hi> which must be dried care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully by a slow heat: for it easily takes fire, and bouncing like a Gun, flies away.</p>
                     <p>This impetuous action proceeds from the mixture of the Salts and Spirits which enter into the <hi>Dissolvent</hi> and the <hi>Precipitant</hi> of the <hi>Gold,</hi> and which reduce it into atoms. Of which Salts and Spirits, the <hi>Gold</hi> by its reaction and its <hi>fixity,</hi> retains some portion, though im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly; for when the fire acts upon this mixture, it drives out the spirituous parts, which the <hi>Gold</hi> and the <hi>Corpuscles</hi> of Salt of <hi>Tartar</hi> desire to retain; from which conflict the great noise ensues.</p>
                     <p>This <hi>Fulmination</hi> may be hindred several ways, all which tend only either to break the force of the <hi>nitrous</hi> Spirits, or to separate them from the Salt of <hi>Tartar,</hi> a good quantity whereof always remains with the fulminating <hi>Gold.</hi> For after all the <hi>Lotions</hi> that can be made of it, it will be commonly found a fourth, or almost a third part heavier than the simple <hi>Gold</hi> which was dissolved and precipitated. Wherefore to destroy the activity of this Salt, beat the fulminating <hi>Gold</hi> together with three times as much of flower of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and put this mixture upon a small fire in a <hi>Crucible:</hi> the <hi>Sulphur</hi> will burn and exhale, during which its <hi>saline acid</hi> parts fasten to the <hi>saline</hi> and spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous parts which involv'd the <hi>Gold,</hi> and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries them away; and the <hi>Gold</hi> will remain in the bottom of the <hi>Crucible,</hi> of the same weight as at first. You may reduce it into a Metallick
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:48577:46"/> body, with the addition of a little <hi>Borax</hi> by a fire of fusion; or else you may mix the fulminating <hi>Gold</hi> with Oyl of <hi>Vitriol</hi> or <hi>Sulphur,</hi> or with the Spirit of <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> and put them boldly in a <hi>Crucible</hi> upon the fire without fearing any thing; for their acid Spirits change the nature of the Salt of <hi>Tartar.</hi>

                     <hi>SIlver</hi> is a Metal less fixed, less weighty, and less perfect than <hi>Gold,</hi> though much more so than all other Metals, and passes for a perfect Metal, because it comes near the perfection of <hi>Gold.</hi>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:48577:48"/> of the Brain, which by sympathy easily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the impressions of the <hi>Moon. Silver</hi> is found naturally in Mines, impure, or else is mixt by Men with other Metals; and therefore it must be purified before it be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed for Medicinal Preparations.

But a more powerful way of purifying is necessary to open the close body of it, and get out every other imperfect Metal. The Goldsmiths use this boiling for the whitening of Plate, in which there is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways some small portion of <hi>Copper;</hi> and this cannot be done without some little loss of weight, because the boiling always dissolves some small portion of <hi>Copper</hi> upon the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

In defect of such a Furnace, place the Muffle in a Wind-Furnace: put fire round about, and over it; which must be gentle in the beginning, that the <hi>Cupple</hi> may heat by degrees, otherwise it will crack. When it is all red by encreasing the Fire by little and little; put first into it an equal quantity of <hi>Lead,</hi> and let it melt and boil, to the end the <hi>Cupple</hi> may begin to imbibe it. Then put in also the <hi>Silver,</hi> which easily melts in the <hi>Lead.</hi> Continue the Fire till the <hi>Lead</hi> be exhaled and have carried away with it the impure Metals wherewith the <hi>Silver</hi> was mixed before: Then the <hi>Silver</hi> will be seen coagulated, and remaining alone very pure upon the <hi>Cupple</hi>

Then pour off the distilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> by inclination into another Vessel; you will find it charged with the substance of the <hi>Lead,</hi> and its acidity turned to a great sweetness. Put new distilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> upon the <hi>Lead,</hi> and proceed as before, mixing and keeping all the <hi>Solutions.</hi> Continue to put new <hi>Vinegar,</hi> to digest, and to pour off by inclination, till the distilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> dissolve no more <hi>Lead,</hi> nor become sweet, or till all the <hi>Lead</hi> be dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, which it will not fail to be, provided the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Lead</hi> be well made. Then filtre all the <hi>Solutions</hi> through gray Paper, and put them into a <hi>Gourd</hi> with its <hi>Alembick,</hi> and <hi>Recipient</hi> in <hi>Balneo Mariae;</hi> and you shall first draw off an insipid Water, the dissolved <hi>Lead</hi> retaining all the <hi>acid</hi> Spirits of the <hi>Vinegar,</hi> which incorporate with it and make a very white Cristalline Salt like Needles, resembling
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:48577:55"/>
                        <hi>Saltpeter</hi> refined. This Liquor must not be distilled to <hi>siccity;</hi> but you must observe this proportion, that if you have dissolved a pound of <hi>Lead</hi> there must remain about four pounds of Liquor in the <hi>Gourd,</hi> to the end the Salt may Christallize. For when the Liquor is too clear, the Salt is too much diffused in it, and will not Christallize; and being too much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of moisture, the whole turns to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Mass.</p>
                     <p>Wherefore then take the <hi>Gourd</hi> out of the <hi>Bath,</hi> and set it in a cool place, during three or four days, at the end of which you shall find a good part of the Liquor turned into Salt. Separate the floating Liquor, and dry the Salt between two Papers. Afterwards put the Liquor which you had poured off by inclination, into a less <hi>Gourd,</hi> and distill off a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a third part; then set the <hi>Gourd</hi> a day or two in a cool place, and you shall again find Crystallized Salt, which you shall dry as the first. Evaporate and Cristalize again the remaining Liquor, and reiterate the same o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration, till you have reduced into <hi>Cristals</hi> all that is so reducible. And in case your Salt be not white enough the first time, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve it with the Phlegm of <hi>Vinegar,</hi> which filtre through gray Paper, and Cristallize as before; you shall thereby have a very fair Salt of <hi>Saturn.</hi> This Salt is a very good Medicine in the <hi>Asthma,</hi> and other diseases of the Breast, being given in some Pecto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Decoction. The Dose is from five
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:48577:55"/> to fifteen grains. 'Tis also used outwardly with good success in Wounds, and Ulcers; for it kills and destroys the corroding Salts of them; it is likewise excellent for Inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, being dissolved in <hi>Night-shade</hi> water, or some other appropriate Water, and then applied. Moreover it serves well in <hi>Lotions</hi> for Inflammations and Itchings of the Eyes. But it is suspected inwardly for those that have weakness in the Kidnies, and parts ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary to Generation. And therefore in this case it must be used discreetly, and with great circumspection.</p>

                     <p>MAny Chymists refume to affirm in their writings that the preparation of the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Tin</hi> differs nothing from that of <hi>Lead,</hi> and that they are to be made after the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. We easily understand from hence, and from several other things contained in their Books, that they borrow one from another, and choose rather to offer to the publick un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warranted preparations, than to make expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience thereof themselves. For 'tis impossible to dissolve the <hi>Calx</hi> of <hi>Tin,</hi> though very well Reverberated, in Distilled <hi>Vinegar,</hi> which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless easily dissolves <hi>Lead.</hi> 'Tis true, the most corrosive <hi>Acids</hi> as <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> Spirit of <hi>Nitre, &amp;c.</hi> dissolve it. But in as much as a great quantity of them is necessary for a little <hi>Tin;</hi> the Remedies drawn from it by help of those <hi>Corrosives,</hi> cannot but be very hurtful, But if you reduce <hi>Tin</hi> into Flowers by <hi>Sublimation,</hi> then it is so opened, that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> can easily dissolve it.</p>
                     <p>Take a pound of fine <hi>Tin,</hi> either in <hi>Calx</hi> or Filings, and two pounds of well refined <hi>Saltpeter,</hi> and put them into a <hi>Gourd</hi> made of good earth that is able to resist the fire. Place the <hi>Gourd</hi> in a <hi>Reverberatory Furnace,</hi> stop well and lute the upper part of the <hi>Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace</hi>
                        <pb n="89" facs="tcp:48577:58"/> round about the <hi>Gourd,</hi> all but the four <hi>Registers,</hi> by which the fire is to be govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Fit upon the <hi>Gourd</hi> one over another three or four good Earthen Pots, pierced in the bottom, all but the uppermost which is to close all; that which is next the <hi>Gourd</hi> must besides have a little opening on one side for putting the matter in. Lute the joynings of the Vessels exactly, and put fire to the <hi>Furnace</hi> to heat the <hi>Gourd</hi> by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, till it become all red; then with a little Iron Ladle put in about an ounce of the Powder, and stop the hole immediately with a piece of Earth or Brick fit to it, which may be easily removed. It will make a great rumbling noise, in which the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirits of <hi>Saltpeter</hi> carry away with them part of the <hi>Tin,</hi> which is sublim'd and sticks to the Pots like white Flower. When the noise is over, put in another ounce of the mixture, stopping the hole speedily, and let the noise pass. Continue this till all the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der be spent, and then let the Vessels cool. After which, unlute them and you will find the Pots filled with the Flowers of <hi>Tin,</hi> like Meal. Gather off these Flowers with a Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and wash them well with warm water, to take away the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of the <hi>Saltpeter;</hi> continue these washings till the Flowers be well <hi>edulcorated,</hi> and then dry them by a gentle fire.</p>
                     <p>These Flowers thus dry'd put into a <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace,</hi> pouring thereupon distiiled <hi>Vinegar</hi> three
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:48577:59"/> fingers higher than the matter. Set this <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace</hi> on hot Sand to digest for three days, then pour off the <hi>Solution</hi> by inclinarion in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Vessel, and put new distilled <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar</hi> upon the remaining matter in the <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trace,</hi> and set the same again to digest as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; then pour off the <hi>Menstruum</hi> by incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. Repeat these Digestions with new <hi>Vinegar</hi> till the Flowers be all dissolved; then filtre all the <hi>Solutions</hi> together, and evaporate them with a gentle heate to <hi>siccity,</hi> and in the bottom of the Vessel you shall find the <hi>Salt</hi> of <hi>Jupiter:</hi> which in the next place must be freed from the <hi>acidity</hi> of the <hi>Vinegar</hi> it retains, by means of the Spirit of <hi>Wine</hi> in the manner following.</p>
                     <p>Put the Salt into a little <hi>Glass-Gourd,</hi> pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thereupon good Spirit of Wine two fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers high; fit an <hi>Alembick</hi> to the Gourd, and a little <hi>Receiver</hi> to the <hi>Alembick,</hi> and set it to distil with a slow fire; the Spirit will carry off with it part of the <hi>acid Salt</hi> of the distilled <hi>Vinegar.</hi> Repeat this Distillation five or six times, always with new Spirit of Wine; and you shall have a <hi>Salt of Jupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> deprived of all <hi>Acrimony,</hi> and endued with very great virtues in all <hi>Hysterical</hi> Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases.

In the mean time stir the Water continnually, which will appear as white as Broth; and after ten or twelve hours boiling, leave it to settle; that which is thick will go to the bottom, and the thinner part will float above, being blackish and of a sweetish tast. Pour the clear off by inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and filtre it through a gray Paper. Then evaporate it in an Earthen Vessel with a gentle Fire to the consistence of Syrup, and keep it in a Phial for use, as a very good and sure Remedy against all obstructions of the <hi>Liver, Spleen, Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Mesentery,</hi> and against <hi>Cachexies, Dropsies,</hi> Stopping of the Courses, and generally against all Diseases which require opening and strengthening; 'tis also very good against the Worms and putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of the Stomach and Bowels.

The Chymists call it <hi>Venus,</hi> both by reason of the influences which pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly it receives from that Planet, and of the virtue it hath in Diseases seated in the parts of Generation. It affords not so many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Remedies as <hi>Iron,</hi> by reason of its Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting quality, which is hardly corrected. But it yields more powerful ones than <hi>Mars</hi> for external Maladies. Wherefore we may well suspect the use of a Water lately cried up, whose virtue proceeds only from a fixt Salt of <hi>Venus,</hi> which being given in substance fails not to shew what it is by causing vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting. And the use of the Water impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated with this Salt, produces those nause<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atings and inclinations to Vomit by irritating,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:48577:67"/> corroding, and weakening the coats of the Vessels to such a degree that being incapable to retain the more subtle parts of the Blood it hath caused the death of many Patients under pretext of curing them of the <hi>Dropsy</hi> and other like Diseases.</p>

                     <hi>QƲick-silver</hi> is a Mineral body fluid, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy and shining, consisting of a subtle Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phureous Earth, and a Metallick Water of the same subtelty, both strongly linked and united together. 'Tis called <hi>Mercury</hi> from its confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity in its Actions with the <hi>Celestial Mercury,</hi> which frequently mixes its influences with those of other Planets, and according to its diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Conjunction produces different Effects: so our <hi>Mercury</hi> easily joyns with other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, and diversifies its effects according to the quality which it gives or receives from the Metallick Bodies and Mineral Spirits with which it is joyned. Not but that alone and without being joyned with others it can produce even surprizing effects, as may be seen in its preparations. Nevertheless there must be much discretion and prudence in the use of it; and there is oft-times rashness in those that employ it, as well through the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:48577:71"/> little knowledg they have of the Nature of a body which varies it self after a thousand several manners, as in regard of the different complexions and tempers of the Sick and of the Disease in which it is used very frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and perhaps more often than need re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Quick-silver</hi> is found fluid in many places, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing driven up by the Central heat to the surface of the Earth; and so it is found near <hi>Cracovia</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> but ordinarily we find it in sundry places involved in a Mineral earth, from which it is separated by distillation in <hi>Iron-Retorts,</hi> as I have seen in a Mine of <hi>Quick-silver</hi> near a Village as you go from <hi>Gorits</hi> a Town of <hi>Sclavoniat</hi> to <hi>Lubiana</hi> the Capital City of <hi>Carniola.</hi> It is so plentiful that usually twelve pounds of the Mineral Earth which is grayish, yield upon melting in the <hi>Iron-Retort</hi> above four pounds of <hi>Quick-silver.</hi> There are also found in <hi>Hungary</hi> and <hi>Transilvania</hi> Mines of <hi>Mercury</hi> which are reddish and have some mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of <hi>Solar Sulphur;</hi> for which reason the <hi>Mercury</hi> coming from those places is esteemed better than that which partakes not of <hi>Gold.</hi> But since <hi>Mercury</hi> passes through many hands before it comes to us, and so may be sophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticated, besides what <hi>Heterogeneous</hi> mixture it may have in the Mine, it is fit that it be well purified before it be employ'd upon the Body of Man.</p>

                     <p>THere are several Purifications of <hi>Mercury.</hi> Some are contented only to wash it with good <hi>Vinegar</hi> and <hi>Salt</hi> and when it is dry to pass it through Leather. But being it may carry with it <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Bismuth,</hi> or some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mineral, wherewith possibly 'tis mixt, this way of purifying is not sufficient. Others put the <hi>Mercury</hi> into a <hi>Retort</hi> and distill it into a <hi>Receiver</hi> half full of Water; and if it has been encreased by <hi>Lead</hi> or <hi>Bismuth,</hi> these Metals will remain in the bottom of the <hi>Retort</hi> whilst the <hi>Mercury</hi> goes pure into the <hi>Receiver.</hi> But the best way of purifying <hi>Mercury,</hi> and the fittest for all Chymical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, is to revive <hi>Cinabar</hi> into fluid <hi>Morcury;</hi> by which means you are sure to have pure <hi>Mercury</hi> as it comes from the first hand; because all <hi>Cinabar</hi> is made near the Mines of <hi>Mercury,</hi> and is put into that form for more easy transportation. Moreover the mixture of the <hi>Mercury</hi> with <hi>Sulphur,</hi> by means of which <hi>Cinabar</hi> is made, and its sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limination doth in some sort graduate and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect it. Lastly the the Reviving of <hi>Cinabar</hi> into fluid <hi>Mercury</hi> by Filings of Iron delivers it from all impurity. But since we resolve to use the fluid <hi>Mercury</hi> revived from <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabar,</hi>

For if the heat be not sufficient, there will be no <hi>Sublimination;</hi> but if it be too great, either the Vessels will fly, or the <hi>Sublimate</hi> will melt and fall back upon the <hi>Faeces.</hi> Let the Vessels cool afterwards, and you will find the <hi>Mercury</hi> Sublim'd to the top of the <hi>Gourd,</hi>

                     <hi>ANtimony</hi> is a Mineral body near approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the nature of Metal, consisting of two sorts of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> the one very pure, fixt, and little different from the qualities of <hi>Solar Sulphur;</hi> the other combustible, like common <hi>Sulphur.</hi> It also consists of much Metallick, Fuliginous and indigested <hi>Mercury,</hi> but more concocted and solid than common <hi>Mercury,</hi> and of a very little course and Salt Earth. It comes from divers places both of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany:</hi> The best hath long shining veins, between blew and reddish. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving well chosen it, you must separate it from its combustible <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which hinders the activity of the Remedies extracted from it; for which purpose several courses have been practised, of which we shall chuse only those that are absolutely necessary for the use of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sick, rejecting such as are superfluous, which serve chiefly to consume Coals and break Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels.</p>

                     <p>TAke a pound of good <hi>Antimony,</hi> twelve ounces of <hi>Tartar</hi> of <hi>Montpelier,</hi> and five ounces of <hi>Nitre;</hi> put them together in powder; then set a great <hi>Crusible</hi> in a <hi>Wind-Furnace</hi> upon a little Tile, that it touch not the Grate, and that it may receive more heat; make it red hot amongst the burning Coals, and get a Cover fit to the <hi>Crusible.</hi> Take about an ounce of the said mixture with an Iron Spoon, put the same into the <hi>Crusible;</hi> and cover it at the same time with its Cover. The <hi>Antimony</hi> will be presently <hi>Calcin'd</hi> with a great noise, which they call <hi>detonation;</hi> which being passed, put more mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter into the <hi>Crusible,</hi> covering it as before. Continue this till all the Matter be in the <hi>Crusible;</hi> Then give a good Fire of Fusion; and the Matter being melted put it into an <hi>Iron Cornet</hi> or <hi>Cone</hi> greased within, and at the same time strike the <hi>Cone</hi> with the Tongs to make the <hi>Regulus</hi> fall to the bottom; when 'tis throughly cold turn up the <hi>Cone,</hi> and you shall find a lump of <hi>Regulus</hi> in the bottom and the <hi>Faeces</hi> on the top of it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate the <hi>Regulus</hi> with the stroke of a Hammer, and keep it by it self; as also the <hi>Faeces,</hi> of which you may make the Golden

                        <hi>Sulphtr</hi> of <hi>Antimony,</hi> by boiling the same in common Water, and filtring the Decoction, upon which pouring a little distilled <hi>Vinegar</hi> by degrees, you shall see a red <hi>Sulphur</hi> of <hi>Antimony Precipitate,</hi> which you must <hi>Edul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corate</hi> by several <hi>Lotions,</hi> and then dry it. Many call this Powder <hi>Sulphur Aureum Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aphoreticum;</hi> but improperly; for 'tis a strong Vomitive. The Dose is in substance from 2 to 6 Grains.

You must have an <hi>Iron Cornet,</hi> or <hi>Cone</hi> upon the Fire, and rub it with Wax and Oil; and when you see
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:48577:78"/> the matter well melted, throw into it by little and little three or four ounces of <hi>Salt-peter:</hi> I say by little and little, lest the <hi>Nitre</hi> make the Matter boil out of the <hi>Crusible.</hi> When the Matter has done sparkling, put it into the heated <hi>Cone,</hi> which strike with the Tongs to make the <hi>Regulus</hi> fall to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom.

Melt it once more, and add to it a little <hi>Salt-peter;</hi> and when the <hi>Ebullition</hi> is over, put It into a <hi>Retort,</hi> proceeding as before; and the <hi>Faeces</hi> will be grayish.

                     <p>IN the making of the Flowers of <hi>Antimony</hi> with <hi>Salt-peter</hi> we have already shewed the way to make <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony,</hi> or the <hi>Ceruse</hi> of <hi>Antimony:</hi> but the operation being a little troublesome, we shall shew one more easy.</p>
                     <p>Take a pound of good <hi>Antimony,</hi> and three pounds of refined <hi>Salt-peter</hi> being pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:48577:81"/> apart; mix them together: then take an Earthen Pot not glased proportionate to the quantity of the Powder, make it red hot in the Fire in a <hi>Wind-Furnace,</hi> and put into it about an ounce of the said mixture which will be Calcin'd immediately with a great noise. The <hi>Detonation</hi> being ceased put ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ounce of matter in; and do so till all be spent. There will remain in the bottom of the Pot a Mass as white as Snow, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining in it the <hi>Salt Alkeli</hi> of the <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and the more fixt parts of the <hi>Antimony;</hi> for the Volatile Nitrous Spirit unites with the Volatile Sulphureous parts of the <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,</hi> and they exhale together. The Pot being cool'd, break it, and pour a good quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of warm fair Water upon the white Mass to take away the Saline parts; stir the Liquor often, then let it settle, and pour it off by inclination. Put new warm Water u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon the Matter, stir it and leave it to settle; and repeat this <hi>Lotion</hi> so often till the white Powder remaining in the bottom be wholly freed from the <hi>Acrimony</hi> given it by the <hi>Salt-peter.</hi> Dry this Powder by rowling it to and fro in Cap-paper, and then expose it to the Air or Sun, and you shall have a <hi>Ceruse</hi> of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> well prepared.</p>
                     <p>This preparation may be made with the <hi>Regulus</hi> well purified, adding thrice the weight of good <hi>Salt-peter,</hi> and Calcining and Edul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corating as above; it will be whiter and purer than that made with crude <hi>Antimony.</hi>
                        <pb n="135" facs="tcp:48577:81"/> But observe also that the <hi>Regulus</hi> makes no <hi>Detonation,</hi> because its superficial <hi>Sulphur</hi> is separated from it, this being partly the cause of the noise, when it is agitated by the Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trous Spirits. The virtues of these two pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations of <hi>Diaphoretick Antimony</hi> are like those attributed to it in the preparation of the Flowers of <hi>Antimony</hi> with <hi>Salt-peter.</hi> Observe also that when it hath been kept many years, it returns to its first nature, and loses the qualities acquired by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration. Whence it comes to pass, that the Patient is frustrated of the benefit of the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine and the Physician of the credit he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from it.</p>

                  <p>THere are three sorts of <hi>Common Salt.</hi> That which is made out of <hi>Salt-Springs, Sal Gemmae,</hi> or <hi>Fossible Salt,</hi> and <hi>Sea-Salt.</hi> The first is made by Evaporating the Salt Water in great Leaden Pans, at the bottom of which the Salt is found very white. <hi>Sal Gemmae</hi> comes naturally such in many places, as near <hi>Cracovia</hi> in <hi>Poland,</hi> where there is a very plentiful Mine of it, out of which they dig vast pieces like a <hi>Diaphanous</hi> Rock. <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> is made on the Sea-shore in Pits during the Summer; the humidity of the Sea-Water being drawn up by the heat of the Sun, the rest remains dry. Any of them is equally useful for Physick; for though they differ in form, yet being dissolved, filtred, and Crystallized each apart, there is no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference in the Crystals either as to tast or figure. Nevertheless <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> is most used as most commodious and common in our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and 'tis purified as follows.</p>

But as we have shewn that the Vessels containing Salts melted in a very violent Fire, cannot resist long; and since Salts retain their Spirits whilst they are in Fusion, I conceive no body should amuse themselves with such preparations. The true way to Extract this Spirit with ease is, to mix <hi>Salt</hi> with some Body that may hinder its Fusion, but it must be such a Body as may communicate nothing of its own, as Potters Clay, or Bole.</p>
                     <pb n="154" facs="tcp:48577:91"/>
                     <p>Take therefore two pounds of <hi>Common-Salt</hi> not <hi>decrepitated</hi> (because in this Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation it loses part of its Volatile Spirits, especially being <hi>decrepitated</hi> with a gentle Fire without Fusion) dry it in a Bason with a gentle fire in order to be finely powdered, and mix it with eight pounds of Potters Earth, or Bole pulverised in like manner; put this mixture to a Glased <hi>Retort,</hi> so that the third part be void, and place it in a close Reverberatory Fire. Fit a great <hi>Glass-Receiver</hi> to the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tort,</hi> luting well the joynts, and give a very small Fire the first six hours, during which the Phlegm will come forth; then encrease it a little during other six hours, and the Volatile Spirits will begin to come forth and appear in the <hi>Receiver</hi> like white Clouds. Continue to encrease the Fire from six hours to six hours to the utmost violence. The whole operation will be finisht in twenty four hours. After which leave the Vessels to cool, unlute them, and keep the Spirit in a very strong Vial. The Odour of it is suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently sweet, its savour agreeably <hi>Acid,</hi> and its colour yellow as Gold.</p>
                     <p>This Spirit may be rectified by an <hi>Alem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick</hi> in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and about three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters drawn off by distillation, which will be Phlegm and some Spirits mixt confusedly to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; the other quarter left in the <hi>Gourd</hi> will be a more corrosive Spirit, improperly called Oil, which keep apart from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. But note that the corrosive Spirit must
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:48577:91"/> be put into a very strong Vial of very good Glass; otherwise it will corrode the same.</p>
                     <p>The Volatile Spirit is an excellent Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy against the Stone and Gravel, it power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully dissolves the <hi>Tartar</hi> and <hi>Viscosities</hi> of the Body, it opens the obstructions of the <hi>Liver</hi> and <hi>Spleen;</hi> it gives great help to the <hi>Dropsy</hi> by quenching thirst; it cures the <hi>Jaundies,</hi> and hinders a <hi>Gangrene;</hi> and being mixt with Oil of Sope it asswages the pains of the <hi>Gout</hi> and dissipates the <hi>Nodosities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Dose of this Spirit is from 10 to 30 drops, or else to a gratefull acidity in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Liquors. The Corrosive Spirit may be employ'd for dissolving of Metals.</p>

                     <p>THis Preparation comes in place, because <hi>Nitre</hi> is the Base of it.

Set it in a <hi>Wind-Furnace</hi> with Coals round about, which kindle by degrees to preserve the Pot; and when the Pot is red hot, put in about two ounces of the mixture and stir it: the matter will flame presently, and the Volatile parts of the <hi>Nitre</hi> will exhale with part of the <hi>Sulphur.</hi> When the Flame is ceased, put two ounces more in, stirring the same continually. Do thus till all the mixture be employ'd. Then Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:48577:94"/> it by stirring it six hours more, during which the matter must be always red hot without melting; which would retain the burnt odour of the <hi>Sulphur,</hi> and the Salt would be grayish: but with these cautions you shall have a Salt of a Rose colour with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out smell, and of a bitterish tast. It may be used without more preparation; or if you desire it yet purer, dissolve it in a good quantity of warm Water, and having Filtred it, Evaporate it gently in some glased Earthen Vessel till it have a scum upon it; then set it in a Cellar, and it will Crystallize at the bottom and sides of the Vessel. The Figure of this Salt is square, much like that of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Salt. 'Tis used against obstructions of the <hi>Liver, Spleen, Pancreas,</hi> and <hi>Mesentery;</hi> it unloosens <hi>Viscous</hi> matter and Purges gently downwards. The Dose is from two Drams to six. 'Tis usually dissolved overnight with Spring Water, and taken the next morning. Persons whose Nervous parts are weak and delicate, must wholly abstain from all sorts of preparations of <hi>Nitre,</hi> as <hi>Crystal Mineral,</hi> and <hi>Sal Polycrestes;</hi> which are not to be put into other compositions but to sharpen them and make them more penetrating, or to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per their heat; in which case the dose must be less than that of the other Medicaments; as for example, with the weight of two or three ounces of <hi>Sena</hi> it suffices to put half a Dram or two Scruples of Mineral Crystal, or twice as much of <hi>Sal Polycrestes.</hi>

It has its name from its force of dissolving almost all Metals, and Minerals, even Gold too if it be Regalised by the addition of <hi>Salt Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac</hi> or common <hi>Salt.</hi> Now, to make good <hi>Aqua-fortis,</hi> take three Pounds of <hi>Salt-peter</hi> and as much of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> or green <hi>Copperas;</hi> mix and powder them grosly, and put them into a Luted <hi>Retort</hi> in a close <hi>Reverberatory Furnace;</hi> fit a large <hi>Receiver</hi> to the <hi>Retort,</hi> and having Luted the joynts exactly well, give a very gentle Fire for eight hours to make the Phlegm come forth; then increase the fire one degree, and you shall cause red<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dish Spirits to stream out; keep the Fire in that condition four or five hours; then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease it by little and little to the utmost violence, quite opening the covering of the <hi>Furnace</hi> and that of the <hi>Ash-hole.</hi> Continue the Fire till the heat of the <hi>Receiver</hi> abate, and wait not till it become clear; for though you should continue the Fire many days, the

But as soon as the <hi>Furnace</hi> and Vessels begin to lose their heat, the Spirits settle to the bottom and the <hi>Receiver</hi> grows clear. This operation is usually finisht in twenty hours.

                  <p>THe <hi>Salt Armoniac</hi> of the Ancients was found in divers parts of <hi>Asia,</hi> and particularly in <hi>Lybia,</hi> in places where the Camels of Caravans rested, whose Urine was imbibed in the Sand, and the Volatile Salt thereof was sublim'd by the Rays of the Sun to the surface of the Sand; and they of the Country gathered it up to sell to other Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:48577:97"/> But the modern <hi>Salt Armoniac</hi> is compounded of <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> Chimney-Soot, and the Urine of Animals. These three are so artificially mixt and incorporated, that though the <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> be very fixt, yet being mixt with the Volatile Salts of Urine and Soot, there arises a Compound of them, which though less Volatile than the said Salts, yet cannot resist the violence of the Fire: for if you put it into a <hi>Crusible</hi> amongst burning Coals, it flies all away. But this composition may easily be destroyed by separating the Volatile Salts from the <hi>Sea-Salt</hi> by the addition of some matter to fix and retain it. As for the manner of preparing it, I will not encrease this Book by setting it down, since the said Artificial Salt is commonly and cheaply enough to be had from the Druggists. But since it is usually full of impurities, we will begin with the purifying of it.</p>

                     <p>WE have shewed in the beginning of this <hi>Chapter</hi> that <hi>Salt Armoniac</hi> is compounded of the Salt of Urine and that of the Soot of Chimneys (which are very subtle and Volatile Salts) and of <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> which is an <hi>Acid Salt</hi> and more fixt than the other two.

The ensuing operation will instruct you. Powder and mix together a pound of <hi>Salt Armoniac</hi> and as much of Salt of <hi>Tartar;</hi> make them into a Past with four or five ounces of Water, which put into a Glass <hi>Gourd,</hi> whereunto fit an <hi>Alembick</hi> with a <hi>Receiver,</hi> and having luted the joynts ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly, place the <hi>Gourd</hi> in a <hi>Sand-Furnace.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the distillation with a moderate heat, which encrease by little and little. As soon as the the matter begins to heat the Salts

                  <p>THE name of <hi>Alum</hi> is given to divers matters. <hi>First,</hi> There is a sort of <hi>Talc,</hi> which they call in <hi>Latin Alumen scissile,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it may be cut into transparent Leaves like Glass.

It is often
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:48577:100"/> found condensed in the Veins of the Earth, and sometimes 'tis drawn from Aluminous Springs, by Evaporation. It is likewise found in Mineral Stones, from which it is drawn by dissolving the same in Water, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Evaporating it. It is seldom used for inward use, but often in <hi>Gargarismes</hi> for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the Throat. It heals <hi>Cancers</hi> of the Mouth, strengthens the Gums, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumes the Spongy Flesh and other superflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Wounds and Ulcers. But it may be used inwardly too, as in the <hi>Dropsy,</hi> and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty of Urin, from one Scruple to half a Dram in some convenient <hi>Vehicle,</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared as follows.</p>

Make the Phlegm come forth with a little Fire, which encrease by degrees till the Spirits begin to stream forth in white Clouds. Then open the <hi>Registers</hi> by little and little, and continue the Fire to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most violence, after which let the Vessels cool. You shall find in the <hi>Receiver</hi> an <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit mixt with a good quantity of Phlegm, And having broken the <hi>Retort,</hi> you shall find the <hi>Alum</hi> there Calcin'd into a very white and light Mass. Rectify and separate the Spirit from its Phlegm, putting into a Glass <hi>Retort</hi> all that was in the <hi>Receiver,</hi> and pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the same in a <hi>Sand-Furnace;</hi> as you di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stil with a little Fire, the Phlegm will come forth first, and as soon as you tast the drops <hi>Acid,</hi> change the <hi>Receiver,</hi> and continue the Fire till all the Spirits be ascended and there remain nothing in the <hi>Retort</hi> but a little Earth which the Spirits had brought away with them in the first distillation, This Spirit is good in <hi>Fevers</hi> being taken in ordinary drink;
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:48577:101"/>
'tis very Diuretick and opening, and is very proper for <hi>Cancers</hi> in the Mouth. But being unpleasant in tast, Spirit of Vitriol may serve in its place upon all occasions. The Phlegm is very good in Eye-waters, for inflammations of the Eyes; it is also good for the <hi>Erysipelus</hi> and to wash Sores and Ulcers. The Calcin'd <hi>Alum</hi> is employed outwardly to dry and consume superfluous flesh in old <hi>Ʋlcers,</hi> and Sores. It may be likewise Calcined in a <hi>Crusible,</hi> or upon a Plate, but we have taught the way to make benefit of all its parts.</p>

                     <hi>VItriol</hi> is a Mineral Salt near of kin to <hi>Roche Alum,</hi> but containing in it some Metallick substance, especially Iron or Copper. There are several sorts of it, which differ in colour and tast by reason of the divers substances wherewith they are mixt. That which is blew, compact, and in great Cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stals is called <hi>Vitriol of Cyprus,</hi> though it comes from <hi>Hungary.</hi> It is very bitter and sharp, because it contains much of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Copper; and though the dearest of all, yet it is not better worth; and I would not advise any body to make use of it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept for Eye-water or outwardly by reason

                     <p>TThat which is commonly called the <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination of Vitriol</hi> is nothing but an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siccation and deprivation of its superfluous humidity, which is effected either by ordinary Fire or the Rays of the Sun. The former is thus, Put twelve pounds of <hi>Vitriol</hi> into an earthen Pot not Glased, which place amongst burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Coals; and the <hi>Vitriol</hi> will soon be reduced into Water. Boil it to the consumption of the humidity, and till it become a hard compact Mass of a whitish gray colour. If you continue the Fire longer, till the Pot be red hot, the Mass will become yellow and at length of a reddish brown, which is that which they call <hi>Colcothar,</hi> wherewith Blood is stanch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; it is also used in <hi>Lethargies,</hi> being put up the Nose, to awaken the stupid senses by sneezing. 'Tis also a great Deficcative for Sores and Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>The second Calcination is made by expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing it thinly spread to the Beams of the Sun in <hi>July,</hi> stirring it often that it may be better penetrated by the Sun, and reduced into a Powder as white as Snow, very light, and less weighty than the <hi>Vitriol</hi> by a third part. This is that which they call the <hi>Sympathetick</hi> Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which they pretend cures Wounds after
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:48577:104"/> and admirable manner, being applyed upon Linnen dipt in the Blood of the Wound. But note that <hi>Roman Vitriol</hi> is required to the making of this Powder.</p>

Let the Fire be small during ten or twelve hours, in which time all the Phlegm will come forth; then open a little the hole of the top of the <hi>Furnace,</hi> and the <hi>Ash-hole,</hi> to encrease the heat a little, and drive the Volatile Spirit into the <hi>Receiver.</hi> But govern the fire well; for if the first Spirits be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver so little overstirred, they issue so impetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously that they break the <hi>Receiver.</hi> Encrease the Fire at the end of other twelve hours by opening the hole above, and the Ash-hole a little more than before; and continue to augment it by little and little to the utmost
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:48577:104"/> violence; which continue during three or four days, and you will see the <hi>Receiver</hi> continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally full of white fumes; but when the red drops begin to appear, cease the Distillation and let the Vessels cool; for 'tis a sign that the <hi>Vitriol</hi> begins to be deprived of all the Spirit it had, these red drops being the Caustic part of it.</p>
                     <p>Note that if you continue the Fire twelve days and nights, the <hi>Receiver</hi> will be found continually full of a white mist: you must also observe that <hi>Vitriol</hi> throughly dried in the Sun will yield its Spirits sooner because it is finer and more Spongy, than that which is dryed at the Fire, which is more compact and retains its Spirits more obstinately; when your Vessels are cold, unlute your <hi>Receiver</hi> with wet Linnen, and pour out all that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains into a body, unto which you must pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently adapt an <hi>Alembick</hi> with a <hi>Receiver,</hi> Luting all the joynts exactly, that the Vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit may not fly away; set your Body in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and distil with a very gentle heat the Volatile, Sulphureous and sweet Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and when you have separated three or four ounces, change the receiver, that no Phlegm may come over into it; preserve this Spirit in a good Viol very exactly stop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. Fit too another <hi>Receiver,</hi> and augment the Fire till the <hi>Balneum</hi> do boyl; by this means the Phlegm will rise, and you must continue the fire till no more come; so the <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit will remain in the Body, which
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:48577:105"/> cannot rise with the heat of the boiling Bath. Pour that which remains into a <hi>Retort,</hi> and set it in a Sand-<hi>Furnace,</hi> and fit a <hi>Receiver</hi> thereto, and distill about half of this <hi>Acid</hi> Spirit, which will be clear as Rock-water. You may either reserve and keep apart that which remains in the <hi>Retort,</hi> or changing the <hi>Receiver</hi> push on and encrease the Fire, and make it all distil over and keep these two Spirits severally.</p>
                     <p>The Volatile Spirit, the sweet <hi>Sulphur</hi> which rises first is very penitrant, and esteemed very effectual againgst the falling Evil. Its Dose is from 12 drops to one Dram, in any appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate Liquor. The Phlegm is proper for inflammations of the Eyes, and to temper the <hi>Acrimony</hi> of <hi>Erisipela</hi>'s, and to cleanse Wounds and Ulcers.</p>
                     <p>The first Spirit that ascends next after the Phlegm, is very <hi>Diuretick</hi> and <hi>incisive,</hi> and much used in hot and malignant <hi>Fevers;</hi> it restores the Appetite, and opens all obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the Dose is augmented or decreased ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as its acidity is more or less agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with compliance to the Patients tast.</p>
                     <p>The last Spirit is improperly called the Oil of <hi>Vitriol,</hi> and is no other than the weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier and more Caustique part of the <hi>Acid</hi> Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; it is principally used for dissolving Metals and Minerals.</p>

                     <p>MAny have imagined that they knew how to draw the Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> and almost all Authors have given us thereof pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations as true as <hi>Esop's Fables.</hi> For many would draw this Tincture with Spirit of <hi>Oak</hi> Wood, — of <hi>Guiacum, &amp;c.</hi> Others with the Spirit of the Crusts of Bread, and such like: and having set the Coral to digest in these <hi>Menstruums</hi> (which rectified are clear as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) because they are exalted by the digestion, by reason of a Salt Volatile <hi>Sulphur</hi> which they contain, seeing the colour red in the <hi>Men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struum,</hi> without considering that the digestion had given it this colour, as well alone as without <hi>Coral;</hi> they took the shadow for the substance, and a forreign Tincture for the <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral.</hi> Others amuse themselves with a Calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of <hi>Coral,</hi> either alone or with <hi>Nitre:</hi> but the <hi>Coral</hi> remained white, and lost its Tincture with the least heat of the Fire, which they regarded not at all; but this not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding they forbore not to put a good Spirit of Wine upon the Body, which by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion, and the help of a fixed Salt of <hi>Nitre,</hi> with which the <hi>Coral</hi> was Calcined, is exal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and becomes red, as the Tincture of the Salt of <hi>Tartar.</hi> By such or such like means
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:48577:110"/> some imagine they may obtain a true Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> to which without reason they at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute surprising effects. I could yet give the Reader many more examples to keep him from relying on many ridiculus receipts, but I content my self with this one word by the way: And as I pretend not to put any Preparation in this little Treatise, of which I have not made trial with my own hands, I will here give forth my manner of a Tincture of <hi>Coral,</hi> which seemes to me reasonable and true.</p>
                     <p>Take four ounces of good red <hi>Coral,</hi> which make into a subtle Powder and mingle with like quantity of <hi>Salt Armoniac,</hi> sublimed three times with <hi>Decrepitated Salt,</hi> as we have taught you in the <hi>Chapter</hi> of <hi>Salt Armo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niac.</hi> Put this mixture into a small <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Head,</hi> set it on a small <hi>Sand-Furnace,</hi> and fit a <hi>Receiver</hi> to them, Lute well the joynts of the Vessels, and give a small Fire at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, augmenting it by little and little, you shall first see a Volatile Urinous Spirit arise, which will separate it self from the fixt <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> which Volatile Salt is contained in the Flowers of the <hi>Salt Armoniac,</hi> and which fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Salt joyns and incorporates it self with the Earthly substance of the <hi>Coral;</hi> after that this Volatile Spirit, which is small in quantity, shall have ascended and passed into the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver,</hi> you shall see the Flowers rise and stick to the head of the <hi>Alembick,</hi> and upper part of the <hi>Body,</hi> which will be tinged with
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:48577:111"/> divers colours as red, green, blew, very plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sant to behold, and contain in them the true Tincture of <hi>Coral;</hi> the Earthly part of the <hi>Coral</hi> white as Snow, remaines in the bottom of the <hi>Body</hi> with the fixt <hi>Sea-Salt,</hi> which contained the Flowers of the <hi>Salt Armoniac,</hi> continue a moderate fire (for a great heat needs not for this operation) untill no more rise: The whole Operation may be done in a few hours: Then let the Vessels cool; and gather diligently what is Sublimed, and put it in a <hi>Bolts-head,</hi> and pour upon it a good Spirit of Wine to the height of four fingers, digest this some days in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and it will be filled with a very red Tincture, and will rob the Flowers of all their pretty co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours which they had before, for they remain in the bottom of the <hi>Bolts-head</hi> white like the Flowers of <hi>Salt Armoniac.</hi> Filtre the Tincture, and draw from it three fourths by an <hi>Alembick</hi> in <hi>Balneo Mariae,</hi> and the Tincture will remain perfect in the bottom of the <hi>Body,</hi> which must be kept in a well stopt Viol.</p>
                     <p>This is a Sovereign Remedy to strengthen the Bowels, in opening Obstructions, it puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the Blood by Sweat and Urine. Its Dose is from 6 to 24 drops in some convenient Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>

                     <hi>SƲlphur</hi> is a Resine, or earthly Grease, mingled with an <hi>Acid</hi> and <hi>Vitriolick Salt.</hi> There are two sorts of it, the one they call
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:48577:116"/> quick, which is such as it comes out of the Earth; the other is common yellow <hi>Sulphur,</hi> which is taken out of the first by melting, or else out of Mineral-waters, from whence it is separated by Evaporating their humidity. You must make choice of that which is made up in small Rols being yellow, inclining to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards green, casting a fair clear blew flame, that goes not out, and leaves no earthiness behind it. Its internal use is principally for the Diseases of the Breast. It is also used a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the <hi>Plague,</hi> because it resists putrifaction, and outwardly to resolve Tumors, to heal the <hi>Itch, Scabs, Tetters,</hi> and other external Maladies. It is diversly prepared.</p>

Note, that all the <hi>Sulphur</hi> rises in Flowers without any separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of any thing, save a little light Earth in very small quantity; so that this Subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation is not properly a Purification but a Rarification only, whereby the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided into very small particles, more dissol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable in their <hi>Menstruums</hi> and more easy to mingle in Compositions, and more proper to be used in the Maladies of the Breast.

                     <p>THE greatest part of these who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted any thing in Chymical Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have imagined that they could draw from <hi>Sulphur</hi> an <hi>Acid Spirit,</hi> not only in great quantity, but easily, and that by several In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments which every one invented severally for his own use; but when their pretended <hi>Acid Spirit</hi> is well examined, it is found to be nothing but Phlegm, or a Spirit of <hi>Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur</hi> made with <hi>Salt-peter.</hi> The true and most easy method is this.</p>
                     <p>Provide a large well baked Vessel of gray Earth, in the midst whereof set a little Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Dish with the bottom upwards, and thereon place another more large, which must be of good Earth, and which will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure the Fire well, in which there is a pound of melted <hi>Sulphur,</hi> put into this <hi>Sulphur</hi> some burning Stone Coals, such as are those of <hi>Liege,</hi> to kindle it, and cover the Earthen Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel with a Bell Glass, either hanging on a Cord or supported by three small pieces of Glass, for the brim of the Bell-Glass must not touch immediately the Earthen Vessel, but must have the distance of a Fingers thickness round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, that the <hi>Sulphur</hi> may burn continually and not go out, and the smoaky fumes of the
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:48577:117"/>
                        <hi>Salphur</hi> may exhale, so that the Spirituous <hi>Acid Salt</hi> of <hi>Sulphur,</hi> may be rarified and dissolved into Liquor, and cleaving to the Bell, fall down thereupon drop by drop, into the Earthen Vessel. When the <hi>Sulphur</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed put in more, and so continue this work till you have sufficient. Note, that you must moisten your Bell at first, and work this in a moist time, between the two <hi>Aequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxes,</hi> if it may be. The properties of this Spirit differ not from those of the Spirit of <hi>Vitriol;</hi> some believe them to be more spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifick against the <hi>Plague</hi> it self. It is given in Julips, and other Liquors to the degree of an agreeable sharpness.</p>

But its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal virtue consists in its Resinous substance, which is separated, as follows.</p>
                  <p>Put eight ounces of powdered Jalap into a bolts-head, and pour thereon good Spirit of Wine to the height of four fingers above it, close it well, and set it to digest in <hi>B. M.</hi> for two or three dayes; in the mean time the Spirit of Wine will be tinged of a violet colour, decant it off in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another Vessel, and pour on fresh Spirit of Wine, digest and decant as before, and do this the third time; then mingle and filtre all the tinctures, and put them into a great glazed earthen Vessel, and pour thereon three or four pound of pure Water, which will break the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine, and force it to let fall the resinous substance of the Jalap, which it held dissolved, which by little and little precipitates to the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom and sides of the Vessel: pour off the Water into a Body, and draw off the Spirit of Wine by
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:48577:122"/> Distillation; it may serve as formerly for like oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>casions: wash well the resine with clean Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to take from it the odour of the Spirit of Wine, then dry it in the Sun, or with a gentle heat, and when you would use it, reduce it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an impalpable Powder. The Jalap which remains is light and insipid as ashes, whence the Salt is extracted.</p>
                  <p>The Resine of Jalap purges Serosities, and therefore is used with happy success in Dropsies, and all Diseases which come of abundance of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rosities: It's Dose is from five to fifteen grains, in some Conserve, or Extract made up into a Bolus, or in Powder, with Tartar vitriolate; but the safest way is to powder this Resine, and beating it together with Almonds, or the cold Seeds to dissolve it in an Emulsion thereof, or in the yolk of an Egg in some broth, to sweeten the acrimony of this Resine, and to divide its parts, and hinder them from fastning to the Tunicles of the Stomach or entrals: which is many times the cause of super-purgations. The same precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may also be used in the administration of other Resinous Remedies taken from Scamony, Agarick, Turbith, and others, whose preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ought to be like this of Jalap.</p>

Take one pound of black Hellebore roots, dry or green, beaten grosly, put them in a Body, and pour on them five or six pound of distilled rain Water, and cover the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with a blind Head, and digest in hot Sand two days; strain the liquor through a linnen cloth, and squeeze the residence a little, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on put fresh water and digest as before; after strain, mix with the former, and filtre it, and evaporate it in an earthen vessel to the consistence of an Extract, which must be kept in a Pot well covered.</p>
                  <p>This Remedy is used in all Diseases which come of Melancholy. It is seldom given alone, but mixt with some Purgative, because taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone it works violently up and down, but so mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it purges only downwards.

                  <p>WE will give only two Examples of the preparation of Wood, which may serve for all others. The first shall be of <hi>Lignum Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> or Rose-wood, which containes two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Substances, the one Spiritous and Watry, the other Sulphurous and Oyly, and both these Substances very Sable and Volatile; so that they must be distilled with a <hi>Worm</hi> or <hi>Refrigerant.</hi> The second sort shall be of the Wood <hi>Guiacum,</hi> which contains also two volatile substances, a Spiritous and Oyly one, both which are closely united to their Body, and cannot well be separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from it, but by the stronger heat of a Retort. For the first, choose the weightiest, and best scented
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:48577:124"/>
                     <hi>Rose-wood,</hi> raspe it finely, and put four pound of it with one of <hi>Saltpetre</hi> into an Earthen Pot, and poure thereon ten pound of <hi>Rain-water,</hi> let it soak therein eight or ten days, and stir it from time to time; by this means the <hi>Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petre</hi> will penetrate the Sulphurous parts of the Wood, and dispose them to separate: After, put all with ten pound of water more in a Copper Still, placed in its Furnace, with its Refrigerant and Receiver fitted thereto; lute well the Joints, and distill gradually the Spirituous Water and Essential Oyle, which come over together confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sedly; and note that this Oyl falls to the Bottom of the Water, contrary to the most part of other distilled Oyls; continue your distillation till your waters come over Tasteless, and forget not to refresh your Refrigerant with change of water many times during your distillation; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ended, decant your Spirituous water from your Oyl, which you will find in the bottom of your Receiver in very small quantity, keep it apart. This Oyl and Water are principally used for Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fumes; and not taken inwardly as safely, yet they may.</p>
                  <p>All Wood which hath in it a Sulphurous sweet scented and subtle Substance, as the yellow <hi>Stantal</hi> or <hi>Sanders, Sassafras</hi> and others, may be distilled in the same manner.</p>

                  <p>THis single Operation will shew the Reader the means to reduce Vegetables into Phlegm, Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, Oyl, Salt and Earth. Take four pound of the Raspings of the Wood <hi>Guiacum,</hi> put them in a well luted Retort of gray Earth or Glass, set it in a close reverberating Furnace, and fit to it a large Receiver unluted, and give it fire gradually, there comes first over an insipid Phlegm, and after a vola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Spirit, which when you perceive by it, a pungent taste to come, put away the Phlegm into another Vessel, and keep it apart, and fit your Receiver again to your Retort, and new lute the joints well, that none of the Spirit be lost, which is very penetrant: neither must you press it by too strong a fire, for it will either press through the joints of the Vessel or break the Receiver: and in this and all other Distillations of Volatile Spirits, the Artist had need of Patience and Dexterity, if he will not lose that he seeks for: maintain your fire in a very moderate state for seven or eight hours, after encrease it by little and little, and continue it till all the Spirit and Oyl be come over: These two Substances come over together;
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:48577:125"/> but after the Vessels are cold, and the Receiver taken away, they may be easily separated: pour all that is in the Receiver into a Tunnel lined with filtring Paper and set in a Viol, the Spirit will pass through the Paper, and the Oyl will remain behind; set your Tunnel on ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Viol, and making an hole in your Paper let the Oyl run into the Viol, which you must keep apart.</p>
                  <p>The Retort contains but the remains of the Wood reduced to a Coal, which put in an open Vessel on hot Coals, and burn it to ashes, from which (as from all other ashes) you shall draw the Salt by Dissolution, Filtration and Evapora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as we shall teach you where we shew the manner of Extracting Salt <hi>Alkali</hi> from Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. After the Salt is separated there remain some insipid ashes, which they call the damned Earth. The Spirit unrectified will serve to wash Cancrous, Fistulate and Corroding Ulcers; but is very biteing, and may be tempered with its Phlegm which came over at the beginning of the Distillation. It is rectified in <hi>B M.</hi> with a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that it may be used internally against the <hi>Pox,</hi> for it chaseth out that venom by Urine and Sweat, and sometimes by insensible Transpiration: its Dose is from twenty drops to a Dragm in some specifick Decoction: the Oyl is rectified by ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling it with ashes and putting it in a Retort in a Sand-Furnace, and drawing off a clear Oyl freed partly from its ingrateful scent, the ashes retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is more gross in the said Oyl: It is used against the <hi>Epilepsie,</hi> to facilitate Womens
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:48577:125"/> Deliverance, and to bring away the after-Birth. Its Dose is from three to six Drops in some Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor: it may be used unrectified to scale Bones, to heal old Ulcers and Nodes, and to put with Cotton into rotten Teeth, in which it cauterizes the Nerve and so makes it insensible of Pain. All Wood, as <hi>Juniper, Box, Lime-tree</hi> and all the rest may be distilled as <hi>Guiacum.</hi>

                  </head>
                  <p>WE will address our selves (without insist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on its Description) to the Separation of the spiritous and oily substance of Cinnamon, whose Preparation will serve us for example in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther aromatick Barks, as of Citron, Oranges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> As also of Nutmegs, Cloves, Pepper and other Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries. Take four pounds of Cinnamon of a red colour, strong and sweet scent, of a pungent and a little astringent taste, beat it grosely, and put it into a gray Earthen Pot, pour thereon two pound of rain-water, with half a pound of Saltpetre, to help its Penetration during its maceration, which must be for four days, which being ended empty all the matter into a tinned Copper Body, adding thereto twelve pounds of water; place the Still in its Furnace, and fit to it its Refri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerant and Receiver, luteing well their joints: give from the beginning a pretty good fire, to
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:48577:126"/> help the Oyl to come over with the Spirits, but not too great, that they may not be dissipated; and this Observation is general, that the Sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous parts are strongly fixed in the Body of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and are separated from them with difficulty, but they are also easily dissipated after their separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; you must therefore distill them in such man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner that one drop do readily follow another, and continue that degree till the Water which comes over have no more strength: change your Water carefully now and then in the Refrigerant, during the Distillation, that the Spirits may the better condense and not evaporate: when the Distillati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ended, separate the spirituous Oyl, which settles at the bottom of the Recipient, in very small quantity, for you will hardly draw half an ounce of Oyl from four pounds of Cinnamon, which half ounce contains in it the principal Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of all the quantity of Cinnamon whence it was drawn; so that one single drop is sufficient to impregnate a great quantity of Liquor with its Virtue: but to mingle it (as other aethercal Oyls) more easily with Liquors, they make thereof a su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gared Oyl, mingling it with powdered Sugar, whereby it being divided into imperceptible parts, they are mixt with the Water, and cannot after be united into an oily Substance.</p>
                  <p>This Oyl provokes the Terms, speeds the Birth, refreshes the Spirits, sharpens Digestion; it is used in Faintings, and the Diseases of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and Mother, which proceed of a cold cause; the Dose is half a drop in any Liquor. The Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter obtains almost the same properties, but it acts
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:48577:126"/> not with the same efficacy: its Dose is from one to two Spoonfuls.</p>
                  <p>Note that other Barks and Spices afford a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er quantity of Oyl, of which the greater part swims on the Water, and is separated by a thread of cotton, as we shall shew in the Distillation of Wormwood-oyl.</p>
                  <p>The residence may be dried, and reduced to ashes, that the <hi>Sal alkali</hi> may be extracted out of it; but as these Salts differ not in their Virtues from other sorts of vegetable <hi>alkalies,</hi> we shall not insist at all on their description.</p>

                     <p>THey that desire onely a good Cinnamon-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, without regard to the oyl, for which a greater quantity of Cinnamon was needful, must prepare it as follows. Take four ounces of good Cinnamon well bruised, and put it into a Body, and pour thereon Bugloss, Burrage and Balm-water, <hi>a.</hi> eight ounces, cover the Body with a blind Head, digest in a slow beat 2 dayes, then put in its place a Head and Receiver, and distill till there remain in the bottom of the Still not more than a third of the Waters, which shall be emptied of the Spirituous substance of the Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. The use of this Water is the same as the former, but it is more cordial.</p>

                     <head>The Tincture and Extract of Cinnamon.</head>
                     <p>ALmost all Barks contain in them a Resinous and Sulphureous substance, which consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes their principal Virtue: to separate this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Substance from its gross Body, we must im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy spirituous and sulphureous <hi>Menstruums,</hi> such as Spirit of Wine, and other Vegetable burning Spirits: we will give an Example in Cinnamon, which will serve for all other Barks. Put four ounces of good well-bruised Cinnamon in a Bolts-head, and pour thereon one pound of good Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Wine; fit well another Bolts-head to this, to make a Vessel for Digestion, close well the joynts, and let them digest three or four dayes in a gentle heat; the Spirit of Wine will fill it self with the substance of the Cinnamon, and will tinge it of a fair red; pour off and separate the Tincture, filtre and keep it in a viol well stopt.</p>
                     <p>If you would reduce this Tincture into the form of an Extract, put it in a small Body, and lute well thereto an Head and Receiver, and distill off the Spirit of Wine, which will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate with the volatile substance of the Cin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>namon, and the Extract will remain in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Body in the form of hony.</p>
                     <p>The Tincture refreshes the Spirits, fortifies the Stomach, thins and dissolves all viscous matter
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:48577:127"/> more than the simple Cinnamon Water: its Dose is half a Spoonful in some appropriate Liquor. The Extract strengthens the Stomach more than any other Remedy made out of Cinnamon, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it contains in it a part of the fixed Salt, and of the subtler Earth, which hath a restringent power. The Spirit of Wine drawn from the Extract is impregnate with the Spirit of Cinna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and may be mingled in Liquors for the use of weak Persons, for it is very comfortable, and helps Digestion.</p>

Put four pounds of Turpentine in a large Retort, whereof three four parts must be left empty, place it in a sand-Furnace, fit a Receiver to it, and begin your Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stillation with a slow Fire: there rises first a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Spirit, and subtle oyle clear as Rock-Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but after you have drawn ten or twelve ounces, fail not to empty what is come over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Viol, and putting to the Receiver again, and
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:48577:128"/> luting the joynts, a yellow oyl will come over, of which you may draw also ten or twelve oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and empty that apart into a Viol, and then setting to the Receiver the third time, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing the Fire by little and little, the red oyl will come over, which is the Balm; and when it begins to thicken put out your Fire, else it will be over-thick, and that which remains in the Retort will be charked, but in case you keep no more Fire to it, it will be good clolopho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia.</p>
                  <p>The Watry Spirit mingled with the first aethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>real Oyl, contains in it part of the volatile Salt of Turpentine, it contains also in it an acidity capable of dissolving Stones; but we will speak thereof more largely in the Chapter of Gum Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniac, which aboundeth in this Spirit more than other Tears and Resines.</p>
                  <p>The aethereal oyl must be separated from the Spirit by a Tunnel: it is used in attenuating and dissolving the Gravel in the Reins and Bladder, it provokes Urine, and helps in Gonorrhea's and Ulcers in the neck of the Bladder: its Dose is from five to fifteen drops in some agreeable Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor.</p>
                  <p>The yellow and red Oyl differ not from the former, but their strong smell is the cause they are not used save outwardly in ill-thriven Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, Scyrrous Tumours, and old Ulcers.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Colophonia</hi> is the more earthly part of the Turpentine, it consolidates and dryes, its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal use is in Plaisters.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>THis Gum is produced by a sort of Fern <hi>(fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rula)</hi> which they call the Ammoniac-bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to distinguish it from the other sorts, which produce <hi>Galbanum, Sagapenum, Opopanax,</hi> and <hi>Euphorbium,</hi> in all which Gums the same me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of operation may be observed, which differs not from that of Rosins and Tears; but these sorts of Gums are filled with plenty of volatile Salt and Spirit, wherefore we handle them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part.</p>
                  <p>Take one pound of good Gum Ammoniac in drops, and put it into a great Retort, so that three fourth parts thereof may remain empty, for assoon as it begins to melt with heat, it puffs up
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:48577:129"/> greatly, fit to it a large Receiver, and lute the joynts exactly, and proceed gradually in your Distillation. An oyl comes over, and plenty of Spirit, and that which remains in the Retort, is mightily rarified, black as a cole, and of no value. Separate the Spirit from the Oyl by a tunnel lined with paper, as you are taught a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit possesses very great Virtues, which proceed onely from the volatile Salt which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in it. But in that it is mingled also with an Acid, which hinders its activity, and dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishes its Virtue, I will give you the means to separate these two Spirits capable to produce ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry different effects. Take one ounce of Coral, or Crabs eyes, or other stony matter in powder, and having put them in a Retort large enough, pour upon them eight ounces of this Spirit, set your Retort in a sand-Furnace, fit unto it a large Receiver, and lute the joynts exactly, after give it a very small fire, that the acid Spirit may by little and little be applyed unto the Coral, which will retain it till the sulphureous Spirit be distil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led over into the Receiver, and rises first of all; but afterwards there ascends a stinking phlegm which must not be mingled with this Spirit, and may be distinguished by its picquant taste; which so soon as you perceive to cease, take away the Receiver, empty what is in it, and keep it care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in a well-stopped Viol. This is a great Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for purifying the mass of the Blood, to heal the Scurvy, and cure all Obstructions: it is used also against the Palsie inwardly, and the
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:48577:130"/> Oyl outwardly, mingled in Unguents: It is also a Specifick against the Plague, and all Diseases arising from putrefaction: its Dose is from six to twenty drops in some proper Liquor.</p>
                  <p>The Oyl resolves and softens the Scirrhus and hardness of the Spleen, dissipates Nodes, and is useful in the hysterick Passion: and all these good effects proceed from its volatile Salt, with which it is intimately mingled.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>ALoes</hi> is a very bitter juyce which they bring us from <hi>Arabia,</hi> in a solid Form in skins. The more impure is called Caballin, the mean sort is called Hepatique, and the best is called Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catrine, which ought to be neat, glittering, and of an high and lively colour, and of this you are to make use. Its principal Virtues are to purge gently Phlegm by strengthening the Stomach, to kill Worms, and resist Corruption. It is purifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by dissolving it in distilled Waters, or in juyce of Roses, Violets, or other, and after filtring and coagulating it, as we here teach. Take and put half a pound of Aloes Succatrine in a glass Body, and pour thereon one pound and an half of juyce
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:48577:130"/> of Violets, put on a blind Head, and set it in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gestion 48 hours, in which time the Aloes will be dissolved in the juyce, and if there be any earthy part therein, it will sink to the bottom; decant the Solution, and filtre it, after that eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it in a glazed dish over a vaporous Bath, and reduce it into a mass. Of this you may make Pills of the weight of six or eight grains, of which take one half an hour before Supper, to loosen the Belly sweetly, and to evacuate (almost insensibly) the gravel and viscous matter in the Stomach: there are made of it also small Pills of the bigness of a Pins head, which they call Pills of <hi>Frankford:</hi> this mass is termed <hi>Aloes violata,</hi> as that dissolved in juyce of Roses is called <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sata.</hi>

                     <p>AFter that of Aloes, we will insert here the Extract <hi>Panchymagogon,</hi> which is common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the base of all purgative Extracts, because this Preparation may serve for example to all the other compound Extracts.</p>
                     <p>Take the pulp of <hi>Coloquintida</hi> ℥jss, Agaric, Sca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, <hi>a.</hi> ℥j, black Hellebore ℥ij, Powder of <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrhodon Abbatis</hi> ℥ss, Aloes succatrine ℥x. Bruise the black Hellebore, chop the pulp of Coloquin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tida, put them together into a Bolts-head, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:48577:131"/> pour upon them good Spirit of Wine, to four fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers height, stop well the mouth of the Bolts-head, and in another put the Powder of <hi>Diarrho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don Abbatis</hi> apart, and pour thereon also Spirit of Wine to the same height; chop also the Aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ric, and bruise the Scamony, and put on them an excellent Spirit of Wine, which may extract their Rosinous substance; keep the Aloes apart, and put the three Bolts-heads well stopt in digestion on hot ashes for three dayes, during which the <hi>Menstruums</hi> will fill themselves with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Virtues of these grosser Substances; decant off the Tinctures each apart in a several Viol, and put new <hi>Menstruums</hi> on the matters remaining in the Bolts-heads, and set them again to digest, so the <hi>Menstruums</hi> will draw out whatever of good there is in them: after mingle all your Tinctures of Hellebore, Diarrhodon, and Coloquintida, and put the Aloes thereto which you kept apart, and digest them in a slow heat for eight hours, and your Aloes will be dissolved, save only some earthy part; filtre your Solution through Paper, and the Tinctures of Agaric and Scamony, and set them all together in <hi>B. M.</hi> in an Alembick well luted with its Receiver, and distill off about 3 fourth parts of the Spirit of Wine, which may serve again for the same use; empty what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in your Alembick into a glazed earthen dish, and proceed to evaporate it in <hi>B. M.</hi> to a consistence fit to be made into Pills.</p>
                     <p>This is a very good purgative, and evacuates sweetly what is superfluous in the Body: its Dose is from 5 to 30 grains.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>OPium</hi> is condensed Poppy-juyce: the best comes from <hi>Thebes,</hi> and is drawn by slash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Poppy heads when they are almost ripe, and this is much to be preferred above the juyce which is wrung forth by the Press from the whole Plant, which is called <hi>Meconium:</hi> but the first being very rare, we make use of the other, which must be chosen black, compact of an offensive smell, and soporiferous, sharp and bitter in taste, fla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming at the Fire, but not with a black flame, dissolvable in Water, and its solution must be brown and not yellow, and being broken it ought to glitter within. Its easiest and best Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration is this: Cut it into very thin and small slices, and spread them on a broad earthen gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed dish, and set them on a small-coal fire, and stir the <hi>Opium</hi> frequently, which grows soft at first, and after hardens by little and little, the fire must be continued till it may be crumbled betwixt the Fingers; in the <hi>interim</hi> the hurtful
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:48577:132"/> fumes of it must be avoided, which proceed from the Narcotick, stinking, and malign Sulphur of <hi>Opium.</hi> Put your <hi>Opium</hi> thus torrified into a Bolts-head, and put thereon distilled <hi>May-dew,</hi> four fingers high, stop the Bolts-head, and set it in Digestion in <hi>B. M.</hi> four days, in that time the <hi>Menstruum</hi> will be filled with the best substance of the Opium, and will have a reddish brown Colour; pour off the Tincture into another Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel, and put on fresh distilled dew on the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matter, to compleat the Extraction of what purity it hath; after filtre the whole, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate it in <hi>B. M.</hi> to the consistence of an Extract; by this means you shall obtain a well-prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Opium, discharged of all its Narcotick Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phur and Earthiness, which you may use in occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions wherein it is commonly employed.</p>
                  <p>Its principal Virtues are to pacifie irritated Spirits, to provoke sleep, to stay the immoderate fluxes of the Belly, to sweeten the acrimony of Humours: it is used after general Remedies against defluxions on the Breast, against hysterick Diseases, to appease the torments of the Gout, and other internal pains, taken by the mouth, and applied outwardly; the dose is from half a grain to two grains.</p>
                  <p>Authors give divers descriptions and prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of <hi>Laudanum.</hi> Some prepare Opium with Vinegar, or other acids, but acids having a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariety to the internal sulphureous volatile and saline part, which gives unto Opium its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal virtue, they wholly destroy it; others make an Extract with the Spirit of Wine, which they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:48577:132"/> draw off by Distillation; But inasmuch as the Spirit of Wine doth mingle it self inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately with the particles of the <hi>Opium,</hi> which agree with its sulphureous nature, and carry them away with it in the Distillation, that which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in the bottom is nothing but an earthly substance, deprived of all its principal virtues; this happens not in the use of dew, which is a light and subtle <hi>Menstruum,</hi> which evaporates with the gentlest heat, without taking away any thing of the virtue of the Body wherewith it is mixed. Therefore I recommend to the Reader this simple Preparation, of which he may make use as of a good <hi>Laudanum,</hi> which may be made Specifick against the risings of the Mother by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of a drop of Oyl of Amber, and against other Diseases by commixture of proper Reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, or agreeable Vehicles.</p>

In the third place, those which have a bitter taste, and abound with a nitrous and tartarous Salt, and have no scent, as Carduus, Succory, Hops, Fumitory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> In the fourth place, those which abound in a volatile sulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Substance, subtle and airy, as are Marjo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram, Rosemary, Sage, Time, Organy, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity of others.

                  <p>Take the juyce which remains in the Body, and put it through a cloth-strainer to clarifie it, and evaporate it to the consistence of a Rob, whereto you may add a little Sugar to keep it the better: you may make use of this Rob dissolved in its own Water, and thereof compose somniferous and refrigerating Remedies for Cholerick Disea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses: Its Dose is from one to two drams in five or six ounces of its own Water: these Juleps are better than those wherein they mix many ounces of Syrups, whose Sugar may cause new fermentations.</p>

                     <p>THe great use of distilled Waters hath forced the Artists to invent a sort of tinned Caul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, large and flat, whereon they set an head of fine Pewter fitted to the Cauldron, of which, and its Furnace, we will here give you the plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est description we can possibly.</p>
                     <p>Cause a brick Furnace to be built, square with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and round within, of about two foot Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter above, with four holes and Registers at the four corners, an ash-hole, grate and hearth, and made from the grate up to the top taper like a basket, for the better governing the fire: your Furnace being thus framed, cause a Cauldron to be made of iron plates, of a flat bottom, and of the height of six or seven inches, with a small bordure of a breadth proportionable to the Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Furnace, so that it joyn not wholly to the walls of the Furnace, that the heat may be communicated quite round: place also two iron bars cross the Furnace, about eight or nine inch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es above the grate, to support the iron Cauldron, which you shall set in the Furnace, and lute it round about to the Bordure, so that the top of the Furnace, save the four Registers may be all fast and closed; this being done, prepare also a
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:48577:134"/> Cauldron of Copper tinned, flat in the bottom, and proportionable to the wideness of the iron Cauldron, so that it may be set within it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching its sides at the distance of half an inch: this Cauldron needs not be above eight or ten inches high: in this Vessel we put the herbs to be distilled; this Cauldron must have an head of Pewter, of a flattish round top fitted to it, and when you would distill any herb, first put sand to the height of an inch and an half in the iron Cauldron, then set your Copper Cauldron upon the sand, and fill it almost quite up to the top with whole leaves, cover it with its head, fit to its Receiver, and give fire by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, till the Water distill drop by drop, and then keep that degree, till all the moisture of the leaves reduced into vapour be condensed into Water, and that the leaves be so dry that they may be powdered: so you shall draw a Water impregnate with the smell and virtue of the Plant; for the sand interposed hinders the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olent action of the Fire, which otherwise would burn the Herbs too much, and cause the Water to taste of burning. This Instrument is not only proper to draw Water off from all juycy Herbs (except the acid) but also from Flowers, as Roses, Lillies, Water-lillies, wild Poppies, and others. The Herbs which remain after the Water is drawn off, may be burnt to ashes, and the Salt extracted; but being that Plants con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain little Salt, or none at all, till they attain their perfect maturity, that is, in the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt their Flower and Seed; we advise not to
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:48577:135"/> seek for fixed Salt in tender Herbs. This Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with its Furnace is represented in the third Table.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>BEing that all Sorrels abound in Phlegm and essential acid Salt, we will shew the way to separate these two Substances. Take a good quantity of Sorrel, whilst yet all its virtue is in its leaves, and draw from it the juyce, and let it settle one day, that its gross impurities may fall to the bottom; pour off the clear into one or more Glass bodies, and distill off about two third parts in <hi>B.

<pb n="241" facs="tcp:48577:135"/> into Salt, which put to the former: and being this Salt is also mixed with impurities, dissolve it in its own Water distilled, filtre and cause it to evaporate, and chrystallize as before, and you shall have the essential Salt of this Plant, wherein its principal virtue consists; this Salt opens the obstructions of the Liver and Spleen, it rests putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, quenches thirst, recovers the Appetite, strengthens the Stomach; it is used with good success in Fevers: its Dose is from 20 grains to a dram, in its own Water, or Broth. If you please you may evaporate the juyce to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistence of an Extract, which hath almost the same Virtues.</p>

                  <p>Having store of the Blessed Thistle when it is ready to shoot out its stalk, pound it in a marble
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:48577:136"/> Mortar, and juyce, settle, and distill it, as we have taught in the last Chapter, and you shall have a Water which shall have all the properties attributed to this sort of Water. The juyce which remains in the bottom must be clarified, and evaporated to the consistence of an Extract; or if you will make its essential Salt, you must proceed as you did with Sorrel, and your Salt will come near in taste to Nitre, but it will not be so transparent, for it will alwayes retain some black clamminess from its Extract, which may be separated, and it is purified by Solution in its proper Water, by filtering it through paper in a Tunnel wherein a few of its ashes were put; and then evaporating it till a film rise on the top, and placing it in a Cellar to chrystallize, you shall have a Salt that doth altogether resemble Salt-petre in shape and taste, and cast on hot coals it burns like Salt-petre. They who desire only the <hi>Carduus</hi>-Water, may distill it in sand from the leaves, in the Instrument which we have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed, whose figure is in the third Table, and they shall obtain an excellent Water, indued with greater Virtues than that drawn by <hi>B. M.</hi> for the stronger heat of the sand makes a part of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Salt rise confused with the phlegmatick Water, and makes it more virtuous. The virtue of the essential Salt is great in hot Fevers, and contagious Diseases, for it casts out forcibly the venom from the centre by sweat: The Dose is from 6 to 30 grains.</p>

                  </head>
                  <p>ALL odoriferous Plants, such as are Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, Time, Marjoram, Sage, Rosemary, and infinite more, may be fermented in the same manner as Cresses; but their principal virtue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists in a sulphureous and subtle Substance which swims upon the Water; we will teach to draw and separate it. Take a good quantity of the tops of Wormwood, betwixt Flower and Seed-time, which is the season of the perfection of Aromatick Plants; cut them small, and beat them in a Mortar of Marble, put them into a Vessel of tinned Copper, and pour upon them a good quantity of Water, that the Wormwood
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:48577:138"/> may be well mixed therewith; fill not your Vessel above half, cover it with its Refrigerant, or Mores-head, then give fire gradually, but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the drops begin to fall, raise the fire roundly, so that one drop may almost overtake another, and continue the fire at that rate till the Water that comes over be as it were insipid: you shall find in your Receiver store of a spirituous Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whereon will swim a little Oyl, which you must separate from the Water in the manner fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing: Fill your Receiver up to the mouth, and bind a small Viol with a pack-thread to its neck, then put a little wick of Cotton into the small Viol, and at the same time dip the other end of it in the Oyl which swims on the Water in the Receiver; the Wick will at the same time draw into it the Oyl, which following the Wick will drop into the little Viol; a little Water must from time to time be put into the Receiver, so that the Oyl may continually rise and touch the brim of the Receiver, and continue this till all the Oyl be separated, which keep in a Viol well-stopped.</p>
                  <p>These Oyls contain in a manner all the virtues of the Plants whence they were drawn. The distilled Waters also after the separation of the Oyls, retain still some good Virtue, and they may be preserved to serve upon occasion.</p>

                  <p>IN treating of Leaves we will shew the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their fixed Salt; and we will take Wormwood for a general Example. Gather a great quantity of Wormwood, cut close to the Root, when it is in its greatest strength, clean it well, dry it in the shade, then burn, and reduce it into ashes: make lye of it with hot Water, and put new hot Water on the ashes, till the Water hath extracted all the Salt into it self; cast away the remaining unprofitable ashes, (only you may if you please make tests with them,) filtre the lye and evaporate it to dryness; you will find in the bottom of the Vessel a grayish Salt, which will be very fiery, but it contains yet in it much impurity, wherefore it must be yet farther calci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in a Crucible with a violent fire, and stirred continually in the <hi>interim</hi> with an iron <hi>Spatula,</hi> that it may not melt, and keep it quite red for the space of a good hour, then let it cool, and dissolve it in rain Water, or its own distilled Water: filtre the Solution, and evaporate it till it be dry, you will have a Snow, white as Snow,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:48577:139"/> which must be kept in a Viol well stopt, else it resolves into Liquor by the moisture of the Air.</p>
                  <p>The principal virtues of Salt of Wormwood, and generally of all others, is to open Obstructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to attenuate gross, and cut tough, and eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuate corrupted matters: they are Diuretick and Diaphoretick, and the Dose is from ten to thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty grains in some broth or proper Liquor.</p>

                  <p>ALL Flowers are either without scent, as Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-lilly, or have a superficial, as Jessamine, Violet, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> or a strong aromatick smell, as Rose, and Rosemary-flowers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> those that have no smell may be distilled and purified into an Extract, as we have taught in the thirteenth Chapter: those that have a sleight and superficial scent, cannot bear the least heat without losing their scent and colour; for this cause the Chymists have found a means to preserve the scent of these sorts of Flowers, by stratifying them with Cotton imbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed with Oyl of <hi>Ben,</hi> which Oyl being suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently impregnated with the odour of the Flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, is separated from the Cotton by expression; but for that this manner of operation is well known to all Perfumers, we shall not insist there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:48577:139"/> Flowers which have an aromatick scent, may furnish Physick with sundry Remedies: for Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, Roses may be distilled in the same man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as Leaves and Herbs, by <hi>B.

Odoriferous Flowers are also distilled some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with addition of some <hi>Menstruum</hi> which may heighten and augment their virtue; so we proceed in the preparation of the Queen of <hi>Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garies</hi> Water, in the manner following.</p>

                  <p>THe principal virtue of Fruits is in their juyce; we will teach the Preparation thereof, and chuse for example the Juyce of the Vine, and whatever comes from it, Wine, Vinegar, Tartar. And to begin with Wine, we say that it is the juyce of Grapes, called Must at first, and after fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation containing in it store of Spirit, which by its own proper virtue reduces it self from power into act, and in its fermentation is chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from Must into Wine, and preserves it self a long time in that estate, till such time as its Spirit, become very volatile by its fermentation, is partly evaporated: and when this Spirit, which contains in it the mercurial, sulphureous, and more subtle part, hath left the Wine, that which remaineth soures, and is called Vinegar: which notwithstanding that it is deprived of its princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Spirit, is yet preserved a long time, by that great quantity of fixed Salt which remains in it. We might here inlarge upon all the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges that happen unto Must, till it become Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar; but since many Authors have treated large<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of Fermentation, we will remit thither the

                     <p>THe <hi>Aqua Vitae</hi> being mingled with store of Phlegm, which it raises with it in the first distillation, we must rectifie it two or three times, till it be reduced to a pure Spirit; it must be put into a Body of glass, and distilled thence to half, in <hi>B. M.</hi> which half must be rectified again once, twice, or so often till it be wholly freed from its Phlegm, which is thus known; if some of this Spirit being fired in a Spoon, burn all away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving any moisture behind, or if it burn and reduce unto ashes, a little cotton put therein: but the better tryal is, if when it is consumed it fire a grain of Cannon-powder put in the spoon whereon the Spirit was poured, which is a sign no humidity is left in the Spirit, for it would have hindred the firing of the Powder: But because this rectification of the Spirit is trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blesome, and besides, great quantities thereof are needful to be had for Chymical Preparations, Artists have invented an Instrument, by which they might rectifie the Spirit of Wine by one single Distillation, and for that we remit the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Figure which we have given in the first part of this Book. We need not much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our selves to make known the excellency of

This hath also excited many Artists to proceed farther, and to seek out how to reduce this Spirit into a volatile Salt, by a farther separation of its superfluous aquosity,
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:48577:142"/> according to what <hi>Van Helmont</hi> hath delivered in his Treatise intitled <hi>Aura Vitalis,</hi> where he saith that one pound of Spirit of Wine imbibed in the fixed Salt of Tartar, affords but one half ounce of Salt, and that all the rest is nothing but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sipid Water; but whereas many curious Persons have busied themselves to stay this Salt contained in the Spirit of Wine, with the Salt of Tartar; according to the words of this excellent Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher (who in this and many other things hath spoken obscurely) finding no success therein, have thought it impossible; experience hath made me see the possibility thereof, and having by means of a corrosive Spirit my self many times reduced the Spirit of Wine into a volatile Salt, I shall here very willingly impart the manner there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of as follows. Put a pound of Spirit of Nitre well dephlegmed, into a long-necked large Globe or Ballown-glass, and pour thereon some drops of the Spirit of Wine tartarized, and at the same time set on a Bolts-head fitted to the neck of the Globe or Ballown thereon▪ closing well the joynts; there will arise at the same time an action of those Spirits whereby they will destroy one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; which when it ceases, pour on some more fresh drops of the Spirit of Wine, and continue this same Work for a whole day, still closing well the mouth of your Glass whensoever you drop on your Spirit of Wine, until such time as the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cease: you will have a Liquor of a middle nature, betwixt a Spirit of Wine and Spirit of Nitre; for it is not corrosive, and its force ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds not that of distilled Vinegar, and it burns
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:48577:143"/> not as the Spirit of Wine: Put this Liquor into a Body with an Head fitted thereto, and distill with a very slow heat of a vaporous Bath what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will come over: there will remain in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom a white and volatile Salt in a small quantity, of an acid and sour taste, which may be subli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and deprived of its corrosive and acid part, by the help of some Salt Alkaly, in the same manner as we have taught in the Sublimation and Purification of the volatile Salt of Amber. I thought it worth my pains to add this operation to the rectification of the Spirit of Wine, hoping that many curious Persons will be well pleased to understand it.</p>

                  <p>WE pretend not to treat of the Microcosmick Tartar, which is a Viscous matter form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Bodies, but of the Tartar of Wine, which is no other thing than an earthly substance separated from the purer parts of the Wine, by the action of a fermenting Spirit, and coagulated to the hardness of a Stone, and is in it self incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible, but may be reduced by the Fire into divers Matters. Now being to give a descripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the principal operations made on Tartar, I begin with that of purification; The first is thus done: Pour hot Water upon Tartar gros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly powdered, the Water will take up its filth, which Water must be poured off and other put on, and this same operation continued till the hot water take up no more impurity; then dry the Tartar, and keep it for use: the second pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification is more perfect, and yields that which they call Cream of Chrystals of Tartar, which is thus prepared: Put ten pounds of good Tar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of <hi>Montpelier</hi> grosly powdered in a great ket<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and pour thereon about three good pailes of common Water, and make a good fire under the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:48577:144"/> Kettle, that it may boyl for about a quarter of an hour, stir it sometimes vvith a staff, and vvhen you have scummed the dissolved Tartar, and let it run yet hot through large pointed strainers of Cloth, and let that vvhich passes cool and chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stallize, and vvhen it is quite cold, take off the Cream vvhich svvims aloft and keep it; decant the Water, and vvash off the Chrystals vvhich stay on the bottom and sides of your Kettle, vvhich are very small in this first Coagulation: But to make them more fair and large dissolve them again in a small quantity of clean vvater in a flat Basin, and give them a vvalm or tvvo, and vvhen they are vvell dissolved take them lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surely from the fire, and cool them, vvhen they are cold, gather up the Cream and Chrystal, and dry them, and you vvill have a very vvell purified Tartar, vvhich vvill be fairer and more transparent if the solution be made in a Pevv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Kettle.</p>
                  <p>The Principle Vertues of the Cream and Chrystal of Tartar, are to attenuate the gross Humours vvhich cause Obstructions in the first Region of the Belly, and those of the spleen, for vvhich reason it is serviceable in Melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Diseases, and it is commonly used before Purgative Medicines, for it digests and prepares matters for a more easy Evacuation, its Dose is from half a Dragm to tvvo Dragms in some Broth or other convenient Liquor.</p>

The Spirit of Tartar rectified is an excellent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy for Diseases caused from Obstructions: for it resolves and attenuates by its subtilty gross matters; for this cause it doth marvels in the Scurvy, and arthritick Diseases, in the Palsy and small Pox, provoking Sweat and Urine; its Dose is from one scruple unto four, in broth or some other Liquor.

                     <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of Juniper-Berries.</head>
                  <p>THE principal Preparations which are made of Juniper-berries, are the Distillation of their burning Spirit, and drawing thence their Etherial Oyl, and their Extract, or Rob, which they commonly call the <hi>German</hi> Treacle. The burning Spirit is made in a Fermentation and Distillation like that of Water-cresses, with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of warm Water and yeast of Beer; but this rule of Juniper-berries will not serve for all Berries, for those of Elder and Dwarf-elder are fermented without any addition, as well as the juyces of Grapes, Apples, Pears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and need only to be broken, and put into some large Ves<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sel for eight or ten dayes, till the fermentation be raised; and then a burning Spirit may be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stilled from them, which hath very great Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues according to the materials whence it is drawn. The Distillation of the Ethereal Oyl is thus made; Break six pounds of Juniper-berries with a Pestle, and pour thereon in a Copper Body, fifteen pounds of common Water, stirr
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:48577:148"/> all well, and fit to it its Mores-head, and distill with a gradual fire the spirituous Water and Oyl, which come over confusedly, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue till the Water come over without any taste; afterwards you must separate the Oyl from the spirituous Water by means of a wick of Cotton, as we have taught above in the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Wormwood, and keep the Water and Oyl apart in Viols well-stopped. Take that which remains after the Distillation out of the Body, and put it into some earthen Platter, or other Vessel till it be cool, lest it should contract any bad quality from the Copper, pass all the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quor through a Linnen-cloth, and press the pouse very hard, let all the Liquor stand and settle for a whole day, and then pass that which is clear through a woollen strainer, and evaporate the Liquor so strained into the consistence of an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract.</p>
                  <p>The Spirit and combustible Oyl are powerful Medicines to provoke the Courses, and open Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions of the Liver and Spleen, to evacuate the Stone and Gravel of the Reins and Bladder, they are also good against the Plague, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke Sweat and Urine. The Oyl outwardly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied fortifies the Nerves, and dissolves hardnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses. The Dose of the Spirit is from half a dram to half a spoonful in warm broth, of the Oyl from three to fifteen drops, in its own distilled Water, or other Liquor; of the Extract from one dram to three in its own proper Water, or some other Vehicle.</p>

                  <p>SEeds are prepared diversly, according to the Substances they contain. For some are full of a mucilaginous juyce, in which lies their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Virtue, as Quince-kernels, Linseed, Flea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wort, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Others contain store of Oyl, which may be drawn by Expression, and the same may be reduced into an Emulsion, such are the Seeds of Peony, Poppy, the cold Seeds, Hemp, and infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite others. There are some from whom comes a burning Spirit, by means of Fermentation, as Mustard-seed; and all those which have a sting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and piercing taste: many others have an Aro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matick odour, and contain in them a Sulphur, or Ethereal Oyl, such are Carraway, Fennel, Aniseeds, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they may be distilled as Worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood, and Juniper-berries, and have afforded a Spiritual-water, and Oyl swimming thereon, which must be separated by a wick of Cotton, as we have said several times. But note that all Vegetable-seeds distilled by Retort, besides the ordinary substances which are drawn from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of Vegetables, afford a quantity of
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:48577:149"/> volatile Salt adhering to the sides of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver, and represent an infinity of figures ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry pleasant to behold: and it is worthy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration, that it is onely this part of the Plants that can afford a volatile Salt wholly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed. Also amongst the Seeds which have an Aromatick scent, there are many which produce not an Oyl only by Distillation, but by Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion also, whereof we will give an instance in Annis, as follows.</p>

               <p>ANimals in general, as well the perfect Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>restrial, as Birds, Fishes and Insects, are composed of a more volatile substance than Minerals and Vegetables; wherefore they yield neither so much Earth, nor volatile Salt after their Calcination. Now albeit this Family is no less numerous than that of Vegetables, yet alwayes studying brevity, we will give Examples which shall be sufficient for the Preparations of all sorts of Animals, and their parts, and begin with the more Solid, as are bones, Horns, Hoofs; after we will come to the fleshy parts, and lastly to Blood and Urine. And whosoever comprehends well these Preparations, may afterwards easily work every thing that depends on Animals. But it is necessary that the Artist choose for his work the parts of those Animals which were of a middle age, and died by violence.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. I.</hi> Of the Oyl and volatile Salt of a mans Skull.</head>
                  <p>TAke the skull of a man dead of a violent Death, cut it into such little pieces as may enter into a glass-Retort, of which leave the third part empty; place the Retort in an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en dish in a Sand-furnace, and fit thereto a great Receiver, well luted, that the Spirits may not be lost, and when the lute is dry give fire gradually, there comes over a little Phlegm at first, and after a Spirit which will fill the Receiver with a white mist; at that time you must govern your fire discreetly, otherwise the Spirits pressed too hard will force the joynts, or break the Receiver: after this Spirit comes over the Oyl, with store of volatile Salt, which will cleave to the sides of the Receiver; continue your Distillation, and aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment your fire by little and little, till no more come over, which will come to pass in ten or tvvelve hours; after, let your Vessels cool, and unlute your Receiver, vvhich vvill contain a spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquor, a stinking Oyl, and volatile Salt. The Spirit and volatile Salt are of the same na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: vvherefore they must be separated from the Oyl and aftervvards rectified. That vvhich
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:48577:151"/> remains in the Retort is black as a cole, but if it be calcined in an open pot, it vvill become vvhite, and very spungeous and light, and being deprived of all its Salt, vvhich is very volatile, as is that of all other animal parts; and it may be called vvith good reason <hi>caput mortuum,</hi> or dead-head, which remains after the Distillation.</p>
                  <p>To separate the Spirit and volatile Salt from the Oyl, you must put about a pound of warm Water into the Receiver, and shake it well that the volatile Salt may be dissolved, and taken up in the Liquor, afterwards filtre this Liquor through Cap paper, and the Oyl will remain in the paper, which you may by piercing the paper cause to run into another Viol, and keep it. The use of it is to cleanse Wounds and Ulcers, for it eats and consumes putrified flesh, and other super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluities.</p>
                  <p>Take the Liquor which contains the Spirit and volatile Salt, and put it into a large Bolts-head with a long neck, and cover it with a Tunnel, which you must lute exactly all about, after pour in by the Tunnel a few drops of good Spirit of Salt, and presently stop the hole of the Tunnel, that no Spirits may come out, continue to do this till the Ebullition which will be made at first by the contest of these two Spirits cease; then filtre the Liquor, and distill by an Alembic of glass in a gentle heat of sand, all the Water, vvhich vvill be insipid, because the Spirit of Salt is incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated vvith the volatile Salt of the skull, and hath fixed it in a manner; and vvhen all the humidity is come over, push on the fire by lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:48577:151"/> and little, to cause all the Salt to sublime, which remained in the bottom of the Body, one part whereof will rise and cleave to the Alembick, and the other parcel to the upper part of the Body: Let the Vessels cool, and gather the sublimed Salt, which in taste near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly resembles that of Sal Armoniac. Its Dose is from a Scruple to a Dram; but it may be made also more subtle and piercing, by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parating the sulphureous Animal Salt from the acid spirits of Salt, with which it was mingled to correct in part its bad scent. Take then four ounces of this Salt, and mix it with two ounces of fixt Salt of Tartar, or such other Salt Alkaii as you please, and put them in a little Body well fitted with its Head and Receiver, and lute their joints exactly, then give fire very gently, and you shall see that the sulphureous Salt will separate it self, and rise into the Head with the least heat, white as Snow, and will leave the acid spirit (wherewith it was incorporated) in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of the Body detained by the Salt Alkali: so you shall have a Salt of the most extream subtilty, which you must keep in a Viol well stopped, for otherwise it vanishes by little and little.</p>
                  <p>This Salt and all others drawn from Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, have very great Vertues, and may pass for the Columns of <hi>Pharmacy;</hi> for they pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate to the places farthest removed from the first Digestion, and dissolve all Viscous and Tartarous Matters, open all Obstructions, heal all Fevers, and principally the Quartans, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve from the Plague, and strongly resist all
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:48577:152"/> Putrifaction. The Dose is from six to fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Grains, in some cold Liquor or Broth; otherwise in the least heat they vanish in the Air.</p>
                  <p>The Salt of mens Skuls is peculiarly proper for Falling and Mother-Fits.</p>
                  <p>This Operation may serve for an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of all Bones, Hornes, Hoofs, Nails, Claws and Haires, and generally for all solid and dry parts of Animals.</p>

This Preparation is more Tedious and Laborious than the
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:48577:155"/> former; but it produces a more pure subtle and penetrating, and consequently a more efficacious Salt. These preparations may suffice as I conceive, for examining and preparing all matters contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Animal Family: wherefore conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding this Section we will content our selves only to add some Preparations of Matters that are after a sort distinct from Animals, Vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Minerals.</p>

A Spirit is drawn from it by Distillation, as follows. Put two or three pounds of good <hi>Manna</hi> into a large Retort, whereof the third part onely must be full, set it in a Sand-fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace, put to it an unluted Receiver, and by a very gentle heat distill over a phlegmatick Water; taste it from time to time, and when the drops begin to be pungent, change or empty your Receiver, set it to again, and lute the joynts exactly, and
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:48577:156"/> augment the fire by little and little, and continue till there come no more over: cool and unlute the Vessels, and put the Spirit and rectifie it in a small Body and Head on a Sand-furnace; and you shall have a clear Spirit, and of a pungent and acid taste, which is an excellent Sudorifick, and may be employed in Malignant Fevers themselves, and in all others likewise; its Dose is from a half to a whole dram, in some Liquor. Some have imagined that calcined Gold might by means of this Spirit be reduced into a Liquor, to which they attribute admirable Virtues; but I conclude that if any good success befall them who use this pretended potable Gold, it must be attributed to the virtue of this Spirit.</p>
